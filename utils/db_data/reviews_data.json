    "review_description": "If previously wrote Genshin Impact off as anime Breath of the Wild; I’m here to tell you to take another look. I’ve spent the last 30 days playing 2 accounts; my main PS4 account, where I spent some money and dabbled a bit with re-rolling characters on PC.I’m addicted & I have concluded that…Yes, you should play Genshin Impact!Why is this free-to-play game a gem? Let’s get into it.So what exactly is this game? Genshin Impact is a Free-To-Play Open-World Action-Role Playing Game from Chinese developer MiHoYo. That was a mouthful!Genshin Impact is a party-based RPG, with an emphasis on questing and leveling.I find it hard to compare it to another video game, honestly. It’s probably closest to a game from the Bandai Namco Tales series than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.Characters all have their own specific roles, elements, abilities, and play-styles.Roles:DPS, Tanks, Healers, Support, etc.Elements:Anemo (Wind)Geo (Earth)Electro (Lightning)Hydo (Water)Pyro (Fire)Cryo (Frost)Dendro (Nature) *No current characters just yetThe Element system is what gives the game depth and what makes it fun. Certain combinations of elements will trigger Elemental Reactions. Hit an enemy with Hydro followed by Cryo, for example, will cause the Frozen reaction, which freezes the enemy in ice, rendering them unable to move or attack. Follow the Frozen reaction up with a heavy attack will cause Shattered damage. Abilities:There is a huge range of abilities. Each character has:Basic Attack Combo with weapons or magic (catalyst users)A Charged basic attackAerial/drop attackElemental SkillElemental BurstEach character also has a unique set of upgradable passive skills.Play-Styles:Characters are locked into weapon types; so a bow user can only use a bow and a sword user can never use a claymore. What’s great about Genshin Impact, is that you can create a party of your favorite characters and play the way you want for 90% of the game.Since we’re talking about characters so much, let’s get to the elephant in the room.Genshin Impact is a Free-To-Play Gacha Game.Gacha? What is that? It’s basically a loot box system. In Geshin Impact, you use a system called “wishes” to hopefully unlock a cool new character or weapon. Genshin does give you some freebee characters over the course of the game, but the majority will need to be won by making a wish.I unlocked Keqing less than 10 wishes after FINALLY unlocking my first 5-star character! Basically a 5 Star 2fer!Yes, you can purchase a currency that allows you to make more wishes, with real money. You DO NOT have to do this, but if you are so inclined to attempt to unlock your favorite character, you can. There are many currencies and systems in the game that you can drop some real cash on, and I’ll maybe go over them in more depth in the future, but just know that you get a decent amount of wishes by just playing the game.While there are tons of guides out there on how to build the best party or which weapons to upgrade for each character, the Gacha element can easily ruin that, since you may not ever unlock any of it!I feel this shouldn’t deter you from Genshin Impact; you just really need to understand that you may not get the experience of your favorite streamer. Even if you spend real money and make 200 extra wishes, you still might not unlock the 5-Star character you want!Sadly, I still haven’t unlocked the coolest character, Diluc. I probably never will.Now, MiHoYo, isn’t stupid. Every 10 wishes on a specific banner, guarantees you a 4-Star or above character/weapon. You are also guaranteed a 5-Star by your 80th wish “pull” – and you may very well get lucky and receive multiple before that. I find it to be part of the excitement of the game.Game-Play:How does Genshin Impact play?I have been looking for a game that plays like this for a very long time. Not since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or the original Destiny have I been this addicted to a game. It’s extremely fun.I have to have 80+ hours into this game across my two accounts and I am not even close to seeing all the content.There are currently 2 unique regions in the game, with a 3rd coming in December. Each region has its own slew of collectibles to find, bosses to fight and quests to complete.There is: a main story questline, daily quests, weekly commissions, monthly events…let me emphasize – the amount of content in a game that is free to play is pretty ridiculous. It’s a full-fledged Role Playing game!I really enjoy the game-loop. Depending on how much time you have to play, you can spend 15 minutes simply completing your 4 daily quests or 3 hours running through the multiple floors of the Spiral Abyss.Genshin Impact is a gorgeous GameOne aspect that I don’t love, but deal with is the resin system.Resin is another gate that Genshin Impact blocks your progress with. Semi-deep into the game, you will want and need to farm bosses or levels for specific loot drops (upgrade material, Mora, experience books, etc.). When beat, a currency called resin must be used to gain the loot. The problem is, you only have so much resin per day (MiHoYo upped the maximum to 160) and the recharge rate is slow at 1 resin per 8 minutes. Resin needed varies from 20-60 per run.The resin system is nothing new for mobile games. Once you’re out of resin for the day, you can work on other open quests, turn the game off until your resin has recharged or…pay real money to instantly receive more resin. It’s a gate that makes sense for a mobile game (which Genshin technically is), but for a whole console/PC userbase who is treating this like the full-fledged RPG that it is, it’s most definitely disappointing.I haven’t had an issue with the resin system just yet, as I still have many quests to do. I’ve only just recently started running into issues where I run out of Mora (a currency needed to upgrade anything) or experience books (used to upgrade character levels).MiHoYo has been really good about adding content in the form of limited-time events (additional monthly quests for extra wishes, and loot), so I don’t see myself having the issue of running out of content any time soon.If any of what I mentioned seems interesting to you —Try Genshin Impact out, IT’S FREE!Really, just download the game and try it out for a few hours. Get to Adventure Rank 7 or 10 (even more wishes unlocked), make a bunch of wishes, and see how you roll.If you’re enjoying the game and playing on PC, I would suggest re-rolling a few times until you get a 5 star or a party of characters you’re happy with. If you’re just a casual player, you won’t have an issue with running out of content, as more is always being added.Are you interested in Genshin Impact? Have you played it already? I’m obsessed with this game, so I’d love to hear your thoughts!See the original post on my blog, Current Kick - please stop by!",

    "review_description": " Little Nightmares excels at building tension rather than going for cheap jump scares. It’s fascinating game that unfortunately is bogged down by some serious technical issues at times.You play as six, a girl whom I assume is going through a personal nightmare in her sleep, as this world she’s in is obviously not real. The game has a fantastic atmosphere that is reminiscent of games like Limbo and Inside, but lacks the polish that those games have. Part of the problem with the lack of polish isn’t necessarily the issue, the game is also running a modified version of unreal engine 4, which has a very proven track record of not being the best engine for console gaming. Six is a 9-year old girl trapped on “The Maw”, a surreal resort that houses sick and powerful creatures. You wake up in the lower depths of the maw, and your journey is one of escape.Little Nightmares best aspects are its chase sequences, which lead to some of the best tension building I’ve seen in a game in a while. The game features about six different stages, (no pun intended) and has various bosses that you have to defeat in order to progress.One of the most refreshing things about video games in 2017 has been the lack of hand holding. Between Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild having more in common with the Dark Souls franchise, and something like Nioh not explaining anything and letting you figure it out for yourself, Little Nightmares is no different. Nothing is explained. There is no tutorial, and the controls are simple enough that you’ll learn as you go. I found myself stuck at one part of the game for about fifteen minutes not understanding how to progress until I figured out that you can climb ropes and chains in the game.However Little Nightmares isn’t all gravy. The game has pretty clunky controls at times. Controls rely on you to use the right trigger (or R2 if you’re on ps4) to hold items and it’s also how to you latch onto things to climb. The other major problem of the game for me is the depth of field. The game is basically a 2.5 D game, but with a more modern graphical style, one in which I appreciate. However, this lead to a few platforming problems for me as there are several times you are walking horizontally along pipes and they are circular, so that can lead to not being able to judge the depth perception of the game, and can lead to cheap and frustrating deaths. The game also has various performance issues. Because Little Nightmares relies heavily on lighting and shadows, areas of the game that involve a chase sequence can bog the frame rate down significantly. While it never deterred from my enjoyment of the game, it was noticeable enough that it took me out of the experience several times.But I have to praise the games’ artistic style. This is the embodiment of a video game that Tim Burton would make, and it looks and feels like that through and through. It’s dark, it’s weird, I don’t quite understand everything that it is going for, but I like it. In fact the final boss of the game involves some of the best tension building in the entire game, and is a pretty memorable sequence to boot.Overall, I enjoyed my time with Little Nightmares. It’s relatively short, taking me about 3 hours to complete, and for compilations looking to 1000 the game or platinum it if you are on Playstation, it’ll take you closer to ten hours. But I feel for the price at $20, it’s very reasonable. There is also a limited edition version of the game you can get at Gamestop or Amazon for $35, that comes with a physical copy and some other goodies.However Little Nightmares gets a thumbs up from me.",

    "review_description": "Little Nightmares is a puzzle/platformer with a strong emphasis on atmosphere. It plays like a LIMBO or INSIDE only with the ability to move in three dimensions rather than strictly side to side. You control a small humanoid creature that has to complete puzzles and avoid giant half-human/half-monsters in order to progress. The puzzles mostly revolve around climbing things like giant, monster-sized furniture, or collecting things to distract the monsters in order to slip by. These scenarios are never spectacular and usually require a fair amount of trail and error. Aesthetically speaking, Little Nightmares is WIERD. The creatures that inhabit this world are disgustingly grotesque, and the atmosphere is spooky and on point. It’s a short 2-3 hour game that could have used a another chapter (especially considering the final chapter is pretty short already) and I would’ve liked to see a little less abrupt deaths.Thanks for reading!

    "review_description": "The trope of \"seemingly innocent youth trapped in a world that forces them to make harsh choices to survive\" has found it's way into being one of the most prominent narrative threads for smaller or \"indie\" games over the last ten or so years, give or take, largely stemming from the success of Playdead's Limbo, and then again with Inside. Tarsier Studios absolutely take inspiration from these games and others like it, but with varying degrees of more or less ambiguity. By eschewing the straight 2D plane for something with more depth of field, and giving the player character a more obvious arc, Little Nightmares sets itself apart from those more famous influences, for better and also for worse. When the game is being stingy with light these can be some of the most effectively spooky momentsWaking up in The Maw, an almost fortress-like traveling buffet of hedonism, a little girl named Six tries to escape her prison and make it to freedom. The sentence I just wrote features two proper nouns that I found out only by visiting Wikipedia as none of this information is actually surfaced in the game in any way. And that's fine, to be fair, but it is slightly odd that there even are names for these places and people when you could play the game and never know unless you actively sought out answers elsewhere. Six takes on quite a personal journey and shows signs of growth and change as a character too, so it's bizarre that this isn't leaned on more heavily. There is a darkness that permeates through the whole experience that's actually really interesting and engaging, but at under four hours the story also doesn't outstay it's welcome. The blind \"Janitor\" with his freaky arms is the first major challenge you need to overcomeSpeaking of the themes of the game, upon doing some quick research into it's origins, the project was originally announced in trailer form in 2014 under the name Hunger, and now that I've seen the game through, boy would that have been a better title. Yes the girl is little, and yes the world is a waking nightmare, but Little Nightmares is a generic title that doesn't quite convey what the game is about. The original title feels much more suited to what's going on because the game is centered around consumption at it's core, specifically in the form of eating. Almost every enemy you encounter is either trying to catch you to eat you, or because you have interrupted them creating food for others to eat and are considered a pest. Furthermore, Six herself is suffering from bouts of extreme hunger, which causes her to double over in pain until her appetite is satiated. The customers of The Maw are all depicted as almost being too fat to move due to their unceasing feasting, but still crawl and waddle after you in a way that is honestly most evocative of Studio Ghibli's film Spirited Away (you know, the parts with all the eating). The core gameplay is that of a puzzle-platformer, mostly in side-scrolling 2D, but with some limited depth of field most of the time. This doesn't always work out for the best, as the depth sometimes has a way of creating platforming problems and artificially making sections seem harder. As well, the checkpointing after deaths was sometimes unkind and a little tedious, especially in the first half. Luckily this becomes less of an issue in the latter half, but there were many sections I ran through multiple times because the checkpoint was down a long hallway where nothing happens for no reason. The look of everything is a real winner, however. The dripping, cavernous dungeons, the messy kitchen area, the lavish dining hall and all the other locations are each wonderfully realized and unique while still maintaining a similar style that keep it clear that these are all parts of the same whole. The monsters and awful denizens of The Maw are also delightfully grotesque and creepy to look at, even if the game isn't trying too hard to be a horror game. Style and tone ultimately make up for the early short-comings of the puzzles and checkpoints to make a game well worth playing. There are five distinct chapters, and even by the end of the second I was hooked and wanted to see where this would go. The story gets dark, especially the ending, including a moment in the fourth chapter - easily the shortest in the game - that is one of my favorite moments in games this year. Everything is a meal to these guysWith great ambiance and monstrous obstacles that each take exactly as long as they should, Little Nightmares ended up as something that I'll remember for a while, even if it's title doesn't really pop. However, I don't want my feelings on the title - titles being a thing I tend to fixate on - to colour this game in a bad light. It's fairly sound mechanically, and is an impressive exercise in story-telling with no dialogue or text. Even in a field that is becoming as crowded as that, Little Nightmares should set itself apart at least enough to warrant a look into a gruesome world of gluttony, greed, and overindulgence.",

    "review_description": "LN is mostly 'experience/narratively' driven, by which I mean that the developer focussed more on the emotional and aesthetical aspects of the game. The actual gampeplay – which is solving 'puzzles' and relying on twitch reactions – should not be the main reason to even buy this game. In fact, there are no puzzles, and due to the lack of responsiveness of the avatar, it is also hard to argue that LN is meant as a challenge (like Limbo or Inside). The most intens moments is running to the end of a runway (read: hold one button and a direction) and slight under a structure at the end (hold another button).That being said, the tone is set really well. The presentation holds up, which means that it is scary-as-hell throughout the whole game. This monotonous presentation is why I recommend players to play in several sittings instead of a single, complete one.The only reason to play levels a second time is to look for hidden collectibles that unlock concept art ('yippie'). Too bad the level design alone isn't complex enough to make you revisit the dark world, again making the comparison with Limbo where the level design is compelling enough.Currently, it's priced with 20 euros. I got it for 10, which is a more fair price.Side note: Nintendos DIRECT presentation of march 2018 included this game, in which they said it has \"complex levels\" which pissed me off because this game has no complex levels at all.",

    "review_description": "Little Nightmares, developed by Tarsier Studios, suffers from the unfortunate role of being compared to two other well known dark grim platformers. They are so similar that if someone told me that Playdead developed Little Nightmares, I would not have doubted it. I’m sure the comparison does not sit well with Tarsier Studios, it being a Swedish team while Playdead is located in neighboring Denmark and vice-versa. With all that said, Little Nightmares is a beautiful grim puzzle platformer with a confusing story.You play as an unnamed girl wearing a raincoat. No dialogue is spoken, no words are written, but it is assumed that she wants to escape from wherever she is. You soon realize that the setting this girl inhabits is a bit strange. She appears to be a very miniature person with doors, chairs and books towering over her. The environment also shifts from side to side as if the whole world itself is on a rocking chair. You quickly find things get more grotesque when the girl passes by a noose with a limp body hanging on it, encounters mysterious dark leeches that ooze from the ceilings and floors and eventually meet gigantic disproportionate humans with large heads and tiny legs.Most of the game involves navigating the girl from left to right. There are numerous doors to be unlocked, platforms to be crossed and enemies to avoid and several physics puzzles involving weight and momentum. There are a multitude of trial and error sequences where you will escape through the skin of your teeth that are fortunately buffeted by generous save points. There isn’t much innovation here and if you’ve already played a game in this genre, Little Nightmares will feel instantly familiar.Some interesting quirks is that the game is visually dark so the girl can turn on her lighter at any time. Also due to the environment constantly swaying back and forth, the girl’s movement is affected. As an example, crossing a straight narrow walkway sounds as straightforward as holding down one cardinal direction. However it is easy to fall off as the speed and direction of the girl varies constantly. This wobbly movement takes some getting used to but I appreciated it because I had to pay more attention instead of mindlessly holding right on the left stick.It’s hard to write more about this game without going into spoilers but even if I were to spoil the story it would not make much sense. The game is very abstract and interpretive with the only common theme being the sin of gluttony. The final act is especially confusing as there is a sudden tonal shift without explanation. Little Nightmares from a mechanics standpoint is perfectly fine. The graphics and sound design are equally excellent and immersed me in its creepy grim atmosphere. It’s the narrative that completely lost me. I’m left with more questions than answers and not in a good way. When I reached the credits, my most pressing question was: “What did I just play?”.",

    "review_description": " Fortnite Save the World is surprisingly funny and well written with memorable characters that make me want to progress through the story. All of the mainline quests have fully voice acted lines; there's no cutscenes but they do talk before, after and during quest objectives. Events have fully voice acted dialog as well, with new characters and story elements that get me excited to come back. None of the microtransations have effected me in game with every item I use being granted through gift lootboxs and events. That being said they do exist and if that gets you rifted then go ahead. You can also earn the premium currency through side quests, daily missions and special timed missions. One daily mission gives you 50 V-bucks, the equivalent of one standard loot box. After a recent update, all randomness from a lootbox is now visible before you purchase, meaning you can see what you get before you buy it. These boxes replaced the old ones and reset once a day.The mission structure builds the further you get along with more mission types being added the farther you get. Events also lead to new missions and mission types to vary gameplay. Gunplay is the same as the Battle Royal but with new guns that are more powerful and upgradable to combat the husks. Heroes have special powers like double jumps and a Rienheart-esque shield bash, which vary combat from hero to hero in a way that rewards having multiple hero units.Given that this is supposed to be free to play by the end of the year, I do hope more people join me in this game. A 40 dollar buy-in is a bit steep to most people, but with all of the content updates, it's worth it. If you play Fortnite Battle Royal, 40 dollars is also worth the revolving influx of v-bucks. There's a lot of content here if you're looking for an mmo third person shooter, but if you're a bit weary, get it when it's half price or wait until it's ftp.I paid 20 dollars when it was half off and have had a lifetime total of 200 dollars worth of v-bucks gained from playing Fortnite Save the World, playing it for less than a year.",

    "review_description": " I was a bit late to the party that was Fortnite but with the release of Fortine Chapter 2, I thought that maybe it was time to try my hand at it and... I think I kind of love it.Now let me state point blank that I am absolutely no expert on Battle Royal games. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried them all beginning with the old Battle Royal mode for Arma Three, but I never got the hang of things. Compared to other multiplayer games I used to play and love, like Quake Arena or Unreal Tournament, the controls on these Battle Royal games always seemed a bit off... always seemed to be against me. Plus, the overall aesthetics and animations seemed to lack the polish of those other, more straightforward, games. And then there were the players themselves that were always… well, a bit shitty towards noobs like me.Since I felt like everything was against me my thoughts were “why bother spending hours upon hours trying to play a game mode that, while interesting, would never feel satisfying?”. Well, that all changed this year with the release of Apex Legends, a polished game, made by one of my favorite developers.Now - I thought - Now, this is a real game. A game that was as responsive and polished as I wanted a shooter to be. But unfortunately, an old problem persisted. By not having the time to really dedicate myself, I quickly lacked behind the player base and to this day, every time I play it, I always feel that I’m THAT guy. You know, that guy that still doesn’t know how to play the game properly even being at a higher level than most and that still makes some awful and unforgivable rookie mistakes.Enter Fortnite Chapter 2.I’ll be honest: I went in having absolutely zero expectations. All I knew is that this was the sequel to a juggernaut of a game and that literally everyone plays this game, from 12-year-olds to old guys like me. So I was very much surprised to come upon a game with such depth and so well thought in terms of welcoming new players. Apex, you better take some notes because this is how it’s done.After the first match I got the basics down, and I understood what’s expected of me in terms of movement, either offensive or defensive. I already knew that this game isn’t always about shooting things but also building things, and that made me a bit worried I wouldn’t be able to get it, but, truth be told, it’s pretty straight forward and even playing mostly an offensive game I found myself experimenting with building structures, mainly to improve my defensive game.This is a game that does an excellent job of making you feel powerful enough at every point and when you screw up you’ll know exactly why and what to do next time in order to avoid it. Yes, I have encountered players that are clearly light years ahead of new players like me, but the game does a banger job of making us noobs feel like they can take even these Fortnite gods head-on. And the reality is that on most games I’ve cracked the top 10 just by being a bit careful and paying attention to my surroundings… and this is a confidence booster that makes me want to keep on playing game after game after game.Truth be told, I don’t know how they’re doing that. Maybe there’s an internal tier system in play that keeps new players far away for the really good ones, maybe I’m playing mostly against bots (something I think Apex should really implement) or maybe it’s something else entirely. To be honest with you, I don’t really care. I came here to play and have fun and on those fronts this game delivers in spades.The controls are very responsive, the aim is generous and quite forgiving, and the whole game clearly has been made with the objective of keeping the players engaged and always wanting to play just one more round. This is a formula that Epic nailed because I really can’t wait to have another go.So, congrats Epic Games!For all the shit you take, you really know how to make a freaking addictive and damn fine video game.",

    "review_description": " Baby got back, and also front, and a... silver sword Spoiler warning: I don't spoil much of anything in the story at all. I have added two videos that are also very light on spoilers, so you should be good. I decided to go with my heart on this as the other titles I had in mind were a little uninspired. Such as: Witcher 3 is the game that Dragon Age Inquisition tried and failed to be. Witcher 3, this game is fucking rad. Witcher 3, enough fat asses to please Scott Steiner. Actually, those all sound pretty inspired to me, but whatever, I've made my choice. Let's get one thing out of the way: Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is abso-fucking-lutely massive. The in-game time tracker is broken so I can't actually know how long I've spent in the game, but seeing as how I've not stopped playing in about 5 days straight, I can tell you it's got to be a long, long time. And the funny thing? I'm not even at the end yet. \"But wait a minute, what kind of reviewer doesn't even beat the game!?\" Well, I guess me. But the point I'm trying to make is, Witcher 3 has already won me over in every facet and the end isn't even in sight. Everything I do deepens the game, the combat, the story, the characters. And yet, after days and days of play time, I'm not even at the end yet. The countless monsters, bandits, quests, upgrades... after everything, there's still so much to this game. And that's the thing, it's an open world game. An open world game that chooses its genre not because it wants to put endless fucking collectibles around the map and then tell you to fuck off and collect them for a couple of hours and then get back to the game. With the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the world is alive and filled with countless activities to uncover. Quests, missions to hunt and kill monsters terrorizing the locals, treasure hunts, random events, and, the most important thing... the game remembers. The game cares. Take for example, an early activity I did in the game. And by early I mean it was like 10 hours into the game, but because it's so expansive and huge, that's actually very, very early. I was riding my horse along a path, I had just gotten out of the prologue area called White Orchard and into the meat and potatoes of the early game called Velen. I came across a soldier who had been tied up and left to die. He had come under attack by a group of enemies called Drowners, amphibian type dudes who usually stick near water and swamps. Long story short, I saved him and he was grateful. So imagine how surprised I was that this guy showed up many, many, many hours later in my playthrough as a bandit leader in a a camp filled with the bodies of his victims. Honestly, the initial act was so inconsequential that I didn't even remember him until he mentioned it. I was amazed, even after all I had already seen and accomplished because, as I say above, it was so small, so unimportant. A little Jim Carey, a little Clint Eastwood     The world is filled with things of this nature, characters calling back to things you did and or said. Another example that struck me immediately: In RPG's like these, where you have dialog opens in a list that you are allowed you choose what to say, I like to pick them in the order presented. I figure, I'm going to get the same answers anyway, right? What does it matter? Well, Geralt and Yennefer go through a particularly traumatic experience during some side quest and at the beginning of a dialog sequence, Yen is very clearly shaken and dishturrrrrbed by what had occurred and I had the options to say something along the lines of \"What was that all about?\" \"What do we do now?\" and \"Are you okay?\" (I'm paraphrasing, of course. It was like 800 hours ago). They were presented with \"Are you okay?\" last, so I decided to do that one last. So I asked her what we were to do now, only for her to reply with scorn over me not asking how she was, as she was clearly shaken. Shocked by this, I decided to choose the \"Are you okay?\" option, only for her to reply with even more scorn as she was offended that she had to practically tell me to ask if she was okay. It was great, but for multiple reasons. 1: They actually call you out on your bullshit(Which happens a lot in this game), and 2: It was clear from interactions like this that CD Projeckt RED went out of their way to build the game from the ground up for moments like these, moments that help suppress your suspension of disbelief and immerse you into this deep, rich world filled with deep, rich characters. When it comes to gameplay itself, I heard it was a very easy game to play, so I started it off on the hard equivalent and it feels great. I do a lot of damage, enemies do a lot of damage. My health doesn't regenerate during meditation. Blocking, using your magical signs and using healing items when the time is right can be the difference between life and death. That's obvious though, because how can you possibly hope to win if you play stupid? Man, I'm a bad writer. You've got your horse, named Roach, that you can upgrade with things like saddles, improving your stamina and allowing you to horse-sprint faster, saddle bags to allow Geralt to carry more weight, horse blinders which lessen the fear meter of your horse so you don't get bucked off when enemies are close. And most interestingly, you've got a \"trophy\" slot, a slot for you to take the decapitated heads of your fallen foes and tie them to the side of your horse. They range from pretty huge to normal humanoid sized heads. But it's not the size that matters, it's the stat bonus they apply. Some can allow you to earn 5% to 10% more experience from monsters and or humans, while other increase your chance to dismember enemies. In the early game I found getting on the horse to be a nightmare, as it seems like you have to let completely go of the left analog stick before pressing X or else Geralt will just daze around waiting for something. Later on, and so far for the entire ride of the game, I've found that getting off of the horse can also be a nightmare. It usually always happens the same way, you're riding around looking for quests, monsters, bandits, bitches, anything, and you eventually run near an enemy. You try to get off your horse but for some reason it just doesn't happen, and then that enemy runs up on your horse, scares it, you get bucked off, and before you can even get up, you're dead.Just look at that.     The auto-saving is pretty good for things like this, but sometimes it can set you back a bit. When you're just out and about, time goes by in a flash. And to die so frustratingly can be extremely disappointing. Because I'm playing on hard mode, it goes by a lot faster than it probably would on normal, especially since even lower leveled enemies can still pose quite a threat. Honestly, the massive open world reminds me, weirdly enough, of a weird mishmash of Fallout 3 and Red Dead Redemption. I know what you're thinking \"Oh, the RDR comparison makes sense because of the wild open world and horse travel, but why Fallout 3?\" Well, I don't want to get too metaphorical or deep, man, but the reality is... video games kind of sucked after Fallout 3. No, no, I'm not one of those \"Video games today sucks\" kind of guy, I mean, Witcher 3 is a video game today, so that wouldn't work. What I mean is, Fallout 3 was the last real game I just hung out in. I would explore and explore and explore, and read whatever I could, look at whatever I could. I didn't care if there was a marker leading me there or not, I needed to see it. I had to interact with everyone, I had to know everything. I loved the world and gameplay and wanted to see all of it. And I did, across many a playthrough. And with Witcher 3, it's the first game that has such a busy, full of life open world that I can do that again.Triss Merigold, reaffirming my redheaded fictional video-game sorceress character fetish since 2015!     You look at other games like Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, Watch_Dogs, Dragon Age: Inquisition, you name it, and you see their worlds and... well, they're dead. Void of life and activities for you. They're static almost. They have people walking around, cars driving, deathclaws, uh, deathclawing, but that's just chuff. That's just filler. That's not alive. The most excitement I felt out of GTAV's open world was playing online and forgetting the singleplayer even existed. There was nothing to do, nothing to see anymore. The next logical step was online. But with The Witcher 3, the world always moving. What with NPC's having dynamic dialog reflecting your journey thus far, or a random enemy getting a little too close and causing them to all freak out, or you coming across a crazy enemies lair and then fighting to death, completely unaware that this was actually a part of a quest you could have accepted, so now when you do, you just jump straight to the reward. The scripted-but-completely-natural-feeling random events that lead to interesting quests, the side quests themselves sometimes being far more important and grand than even the main quests. The incredibly weather effects that actually manage to instill worry in my gut as the winds howl and the trees bend, with the crack of lightning ringing out like a bell in silence. It goes on. I haven't even mentioned the incredible voice cast in this game. I have yet to hear a single line of dialog that wasn't well delivered. Geralt, for example, is one sassy motherfucker and I love it. His voice actor sells the lines incredibly so. Mastercraft if I've ever heard it. Geralt goes from being friendly and kind to being a sarcastic and cheeky bastard. It never feels out of place or forced, as it is usually up to you to choose the dialog option yourself. Though, sometimes characters do call you out on it.Video 1 The dialog is well written, which it probably should be since the games are adapted from novels. Combined with the fantastic voice acting and you can be safe to assume that when a cutscene comes on, you will be entertained. The framing is also pretty good. There's your standard \"character talks, turns around so that everyone is facing their back and then says something dramatic\" shit going on, but they make a valiant effort to make the shots as nice as they possibly can. And it pays off. Each shot is well directed, tying into the extreme amount of effort that went into the game. It's accented by some serious facial animation technology goings ons that show you what a character is feeling before they even say anything. It's not, say, as accurate as what we've seen from MGSV, but it has been one hundred percent effective at conveying emotion and tone. The eyes in particular are incredibly well animated.Video 2   Really, the storytelling in this game is exceptionally well done. There's one side mission in the game that goes from an almost slapstick comedy routine only to evolve into a deathly serious murder mystery. The tonal change is striking, but to be expected. The Witcher 3 may be fantasy, but there is nothing happy-go-lucky about this world. Darkness looms overhead at all times, reaching down from time to time to remind you that not all is safe. Yet there Geralt stands, like a pun-making beacon of light, ready to tell people to go fuck themselves and then stab them in the face with a sick ass silver sword. Honestly, this review is a little off the wall since I didn't get into basic plot details or specific controls, you know, like a real reviewer would, but I mean, this game is out there, that shit is well documented already. I wanted to share my viewpoint, my feelings. From the heart or some shit. You know? The Witcher 3 has a lot of heart, and it resonates well with me for more than just the reasons I've listed above, as I've omitted several story related spoilers as that's something that should best be experienced by yourself. But when it comes to my opinion, this game is one of the best. A must buy, for everyone.",

Reasons for this was the controls was awfull, the main characters voice sounded too over the top and unrealistic, you cant jump on the horse will moving as you have to stand still then press X, random people you talk to just say a something like..... oh yeah !?! I just thought it was really dispionting and felt too basic for me. But graphics was good and the idea but for me i just thought it was trying to be a Skyrim wanna be a just failed big time.

    "review_description": "After 95 hours, I've concluded the main quest line of the game. I still have around 20 quests in my journal. Granted mostly involving Gwent(the collectable trading card game). However there are still a number of contracts left unfulfilled. As well as points of interest unexplored scattered about the map.At some point in the story I came to the conclusion that most of the game was almost entirely scripted into one general narrative. I was wrong. The choices you make are so subtle and dynamic that the story completely and entirely changes the world. This was eluded to by speaking with people at similar points in the narrative who had COMPLETELY different outcomes for specific events. Additionally, its not like Witcher 2 where there were say around 4 or 5 decisions that would turn the tide. Witcher 3 has more like 50 that are interwoven to a degree that upon completing the game and reading a guide I still do not know all the outcomes nor how to achieve them.Now, this game had a little rough patch at launch. People complaining about character movement speed. A sort of dead zone of zero reaction to immediate sprinting. Character interaction where Geralt would find putting out candles more interesting than opening a chest full of hot loot. I didn't find those issues that much of an annoyance. However, riding Roach (the horse) became at least for me, a sort of nightmare. Roach had trouble starting into a sprint and even more trouble going near things that were not flat ground. Dead stop running next to rocks. Yeah, next to rocks. I soon gave up on trying to get what I'd call medium distances on horseback. I'd use the cantor as the the slower speed allowed for more control. Especially because even though Roach does not lose stamina on roads, he'd also run almost every time when approaching a fork the wrong way and then dead stop next to a rock. But I digress. Those issues are not that big of a deal.The only other glitches I've saw were that of which you'd expect to see in any other open world game.Reading this back to myself, it seems mildly negative. It is not my intention. I just felt those issues needed to be addressed.As far as barrier of entry, this is by far the easiest to get into of the Witcher series. Potions can be crafted at any time and drank during battle. Which is a huge departure from previous iterations. Which, in my opinion is nice but it also takes away from the difficulty. Looking back I wish I had played on a higher difficulty. I went with Normal(Story and Sword) as my previous experience with the series suggested to my feeble mind. Additionally, using alcohest or a strong alcohol to remake every single potion and bomb seemed so trivial. Previously each potion required all ingredients and when it was gone, it was gone. But again, Making it easier usually brings more people in and from a business aspect I completely understand. So it goes.Overall, the way the narrative progression feels so organic that it seems scripted as if you had no choice begin with even though you actually have all the choice. Combined with the dozens of hours of side quests that feel like almost entirely separate plot threads. Rather enjoyable combat that doesn't get tired until well past your interest in the story has subsided. With at times needing to actually read the Bestiary in order to gain the upper hand on a contract. With great voice acting that makes you actually want to listen to the NPC's rather than skip all the dialogue and just ask where the next waypoint is; Makes for such a complete package that it makes me feel emotionally attached. Easily one of the best games I've ever played.",

    "review_description": " The Witcher 3 manages to mix the best things about the first two games into a open world environment. First up the story is more compelling since it is about Geralt trying to find and help his daughter Ciri. Along the way he meets a cast of interesting characters like the often mentioned Bloody Baron. Which gives the player a reason to keep heading down the main story path more so than most open world games. Along with that the gameplay finally feels like a action game that lets me dodge and counter attack enemies without it feeling stiff. Figuring out enemies weakness by using the bestiary gives the player a way to come out on top. Even the side content is more interesting than the past few games like the collectible card game Gwent. Plus the side quests in thie game might end up being a drawn out affair that go in a completely different direction so it is worth seeking out every ? mark on the map if you have the time to check it out.With every high point in the story it also has a few low points that drag out the story out for a bit to long. Like the first time he ventures to the Skellige isles which feels more like a side act where he doesn't learn anything new. Maybe because I've been playing through all the Witcher games I didn't notice it but I should at least bring up that Geralt's movement might feel weird compared to other games. In the end the possessives outweigh any negatives that I have about this game. If your looking for a open world adventure with a lot of great content then check out this game.",

    "review_description": "Enter a world that has been scarred from abuse, megalomania, and thievery, yet also retains attributes of simplicity and lush landscape. Flora and fauna exquisitely coexist in harmony, joined together against the unwritten war of beings. Emotional tales of absolution and personal triumph leak through its sea of content. In the midst of an overarching struggle, a lone monster hunter seeks for a reunion of a girl he sees like a daughter. This is the world containing several provinces such as Novigrad, Redania and Nilfgaard. This is the world of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.Gone are the roaming restrictions from past games in the franchise, and now in is an enhanced and fully accessible open-world. Have no fear, the level of precise detail from past entries are still apparent in The Witcher 3, and those kinds of locations are now connected with the occasional village in between. Certain settlements subtly contain their own self-contained stories to them; originating from aspects of aristocracy, abandonment, and economic struggle. NPCs within these locations are extremely well animated, and the ways they react to the game's environmental effects is commendable. The actual open-world may not be quite as impressive as what developer Rockstar has achieved with recent Grand Theft Auto iterations, but it's still a marvel to experience. Don't come to this setting expecting a player-focused sandbox experience like Skyrim; you are in fact role-playing as Geralt of Rivia. Come here to see for yourself the level of polish CD Projekt Red has been able to craft themselves.Geralt of Rivia once returns to the series to act as the main protagonist, however his intentions have changed. Time is growing short, and Geralt is looking to move on with his own life. In contrast to its predecessors, The Witcher 3 slightly departs from the overarching political tension and grand story elements of its predecessor in favor of a more personal embarkment. When Assassins of Kings began with an explosive start with a bang, Wild Hunt starts with a quiet and subtle whimper. With the possible exception the game's denouement, The Witcher 3 never really reaches those heights. At its most basic level, the game's story is just Geralt's search for his daughter figure Ciri, all while preparing for the impending battle with the Wild Hunt, a set of winter specters strangely similar to the White Walkers from A Song of Ice and Fire. It's not the general narrative that makes it so great, it's everything in between. Nearly every named NPC has their own struggle to overcome, and seeing those individual stories play out to the end is always intriguing and equally satisfying.I would never necessarily deem The Witcher 3 a game with a great story, partially due to it's simplistic nature, but rather a masterclass in story-telling. So many interactions between characters subtlety affect later areas of the game. Not to mention that certain quest-lines will ultimately determine who marches with you at the gates against the Wild Hunt, somewhat akin the loyalty missions from Mass Effect 2. The game advances the medium's use of choice, utilizing the feature in a fashion that prevents the player from knowing when a choice has been made, but ensures they know what the repercussion is when it rolls around. If you consider the \"story\" of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to include all the web-connected narratives from seemingly insignificant NPCs and the adjacent charater studies it presents, then yes: The Witcher 3 has one of the most incredible stories I've ever experienced in a game.From top to bottom, all gameplay components have been further streamlined from The Witcher 2. Its difficulty is considerably easier, the controls are more intuitive, the progression system has been refined, and the UI has become much more manageable. Due to past criticism, a much-needed tutorial to explain its systems has been included as well in the starting areas. Combat is largely the same as what was incorporated into Assassins of Kings. It retains the somewhat hybrid RPG form of hack-and-slash and strategic battle, splitting sword duties between creatures and beings respectively but also instantiating magical signs on occasions. Returning is the emphasis on play-style, whether you want to focus on upgrading the powers of your signs, brewing better potions, or learning additional sword tactics. Exploration has not transitioned as gracefully. While I admire the addition of fast-travel and your horse Roach, Geralt himself frankly controls like a truck. From the time of pressing forward, there is about a full second until you actually move onward. It can get a fair bit irritating, especially when picking up loot in a tight space, but literally every other aspect makes up for this simple rough patch.While hunting monsters and acting like a detective in this 60+ hour RPG, there is an ongoing card-collecting game to engross yourself in place of the dice mini-games from previous titles. Named Gwent, this in-game card mechanic is somewhat akin to the incorporated Triple Triad found in Final Fantasy VIII. Cards can be won and generally attained in similar ways, but actual games inarguably take longer to complete. While I got deep into Triple Triad in its respective RPG game, I personally didn't spent too much time in the decks of Gwent. It's certainly well made, and I already know many people find it intriguing, but I personally found its pace a tad too slow.Despite a nerfed outlook from what was previously shown before release, The Witcher 3 looks fantastic, particularly on PC. My personal favorite aspect of the visual design was the way flora elements were designed, especially in regards to the supposed wind and other weather effects. Creature designs are simultaneously memorable and intimidating, thus exemplifying its effectiveness. Character models look great, especially with its coinciding facial animation, but of course the game isn't without its technical hiccups. NPCs and Geralt himself will occasionally clip through objects in the world and once or twice my audio got cut off completely. Granted, I didn't have as many issues as I've read PS4 and Xbox One users have had, but from what I've witnessed, all glitches were very minimal and overall perfectly acceptable.Games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are rare occurrences in this industry. While there are no doubt overarching technical flaws found in each version, the core game here is absolutely superb. Not since The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim have I seen the general gaming community literally drooling over a title like this. And rightly so - this is nothing less than an achievement. Ultimately, The Witcher 3 is an unforgettable trek and an instant classic.",

    "review_description": " Alright, welcome to my first video game review in which we will be focussing on the popular game title, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. An important piece of information to bear in mind as you read through this review is that I was playing on the Xbox One. This will matter when I begin to talk about things such as graphics and controls, however it will not effect things like the storyline. As I am sure you are aware this game has been out for some time already, being released in mid May of 2015. This will be a great starting review for me as I have had a good amount of time invested into fully exploring the game. Also I feel that The Witcher 3 is an incredibly balanced game for me to review as it has many great aspects, however other aspects are underdeveloped and sometimes frustrating.The Witcher 3, the final in the Witcher trilogy, is an open world RPG in which you play Geralt of Rivia, a renowned monster slayer (Witcher). As someone who is very new to the Witcher series, I am pleased to tell you that in order to play you need no prior experience with the other two games. The storyline is very friendly to us newbies to the trilogy and doesn’t require you to have some kind of outside knowledge to understand what is going on.Here is a basic synopsis of what is going on in this virtual world… The ‘Nilfgaardian Empire’ are the dominant force throughout and are working on taking over the remaining kingdoms that are still independent of this force. Ciri, a daughter like figure to Geralt, is being tracked down by the ‘Wild Hunt’ due to her immense powers. This group of specters, led by the King of the Wild Hunt are only known as legend to most of the characters throughout the game. Geralt is set on finding Ciri and ridding the world of the Wild Hunt, for Ciri’s sake. Of course it would not be a Witcher game without a series of love afflictions and sex scenes.Right okay, enough talk, let’s get this review on the road… To begin, I am going to discuss the basics; graphics, controls, general feel of the game. Basically the things that hit you immediately when thrown into the game.VisualsThe very first thing you are going to notice upon starting the game are the graphics. You are sure to notice that The Witcher 3 is a very pretty game visually. All too often in games these days atmosphere is drawn from colour, or the lack thereof. A lack of contrast and an overuse of greys and dull colours can lead to a very boring virtual world. Not here though. In this game the colours are vibrant and bold, making exploring and wandering around the vast open areas a joy. What I will say however, is that upon closer inspection the graphics are relatively basic. I say this in the nicest way possible as they are still very impressive, just nothing groundbreaking. Some of the textures blend together and it would appear that they used some of the NPC’s character models very repetitively, to the point where I would often get confused to whether or not I was talking to someone different, or someone I had met earlier in the game. It would also seem that CD Project Red (the developers of the game) have been somewhat lazy when designing some of the armour and hair/facial hairstyles. By this I mean that often when wearing a new set of armour you will find that your hair clips through it rather than resting on it. Finally, the text in the menus and on the HUD were very very small. As someone who sits at an average distance from the screen with decent eyesight, I would often struggle to read some of the text. All very minor details that I wish not to dwell on too much. On the whole then I can conclude that it is a particularly pretty and very visually pleasing game.Character ControlThe controls and feel of the game then. Perhaps one of the most important things in a game, after all it is something that you are going to have to play with throughout. The controls themselves are all fine. Nothing unusual and the buttons were very easy and quick to learn. I wasn’t wading through a labyrinth of button combinations to complete simple tasks. However, I often felt like I was manoeuvring the Titanic when walking around with Geralt. It felt somewhat clunky and particularly slow and sluggish, especially when going into or out of water. Things like small doorways or trapdoors were very difficult to navigate – and as for Roach, your ‘faithful steed’, I often found I would prefer to simply walk than even have to deal with his shenanigans. His reluctantly to go anywhere near water, his abrupt halts when he hits the smallest of shrubs, the way that when you ‘summon’ him, he will often spawn far away from you and then struggle to find his way to you.The combat however is a completely different story. The combat felt fluent and accurate. I felt completely in control and like I genuinely had to use the correct methods in order to survive. All too often in games combat becomes a button bashing fest in which you simply hit the attack button as many times, as hard as you can and the creature will surely die. Not in The Witcher 3. You simply have to make the most of the dodges, counter attacks, potions, strong attacks, weak attacks and special abilities. Even on the easiest difficulty you will find yourself being dominated if you simply mash the attack button.MenusAs far as the menus are concerned, they are about as good as they can be. There is a lot of information to have to relay to the player such as alchemy, inventory, quests, the map, the levelling up page and more. They have found a way in which to present all of these options to you, without bombarding you with information and simply confusing the player.GameplaySo enough about the technical things, let’s talk about the game itself; the storyline, the fun factor. After all, that is the main thing that this game has to shout about! I am most certainly going to try to avoid spoilers at all costs, so feel free to read on without me detracting some of the drama for you.I have to say this has to be one of the most exciting storylines I have played in a long time. For a game that boasts a very long main quest line, it’s ability to have a grasp on me in such a way that I am urged to get back to playing it whenever I am away, is incredible. You travel from place to place in the huge expansive world, completing quests for various different people throughout the game. The game is set out in such a way that you should be able to go through the main quest line without struggle. It isn’t the type of game in which as you level up, the enemies around you become more powerful as well. In fact, the enemies don’t change. They are at their own level and nothing will change that, you simply have to level up yourself until you are strong enough to contend with them. This adds another layer of realism to the game. If you are struggling with a quest it is always a good idea to go away, do some other little side quests, level up a little and come back and try again. As I played through, I very much stuck to the main quests, doing the odd side quest here and there. However, if you were to ‘100%’ this game, you could spend weeks and months trying to do so with a vast amount of activities to do.Throughout the game you will meet a multitude of weird and wonderful characters that you can do things for in return for currency, items, or in some cases, sexual favours… All things considered, this is possibly one of the best value for money games I have bought since Skyrim! One picking point I do have however, was one that I found particularly frustrating. As you come towards the end of the main quest line you are given a prompt to save the game. Basically, if you go on to complete the main quest line most of the side quests become null and void; you cannot complete them anymore. This was annoying as, like in Skyrim, I like to play through the main game and then come back later to do all of the side quests etc. However, you simply are not given that option in The Witcher 3.GeraltOkay, I’ve spoken about the game in depth, but I haven’t yet gave you an overdue review of the man who you are going to be spending a lot of time with; Geralt himself. When playing games such as Witcher, where you, the protagonist are the hero, trying to overcome an evil force in order to save loved ones, you want that said protagonist to be amazing. Too many times in games does your character come across as unimpressive, perhaps overconfident and arrogant, or maybe overpowered? Well I think Geralt strikes a perfect combination. He is far from overpowered in the sense that as mentioned earlier, you absolutely have to play smart and strategically and cannot simply tank as many enemies as you wish at once. He certainly is impressive though. He more than stands out from the crowd as a large, towering, powerful man, laced with the finest armour carrying two swords on his back. With nimble accurate moves and magic powers known as ‘signs’. He also wonders around with a tone of arrogance that is far from annoying, and more simply… Awesome.GwentSo great! A beautifully visual game, a badass protagonist, a compelling storyline with a tonne of extra activities to partake in, and plenty of women to keep you occupied as you go. But wait, there’s more! The Witcher 3 even has a built in card game called ‘Gwent’… This isn’t just another silly little side quest that you can complete once or twice, but a whole new activity in which you can buy/win/trade cards, play against other NPCs throughout the game, win prizes and money. It is marvellously in depth as well. I have even heard stories of how people are going out and buying the game, simply for the addition of Gwent… If you have been even remotely considering buying this game as of late, I strongly urge you to, even just down to its incredible value for money, and how much play time you are going to get out of your £55.It’s not all good news…Okay okay, so it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. I do have some things to point my finger at and pick holes in. Before I go on, I want to make it absolutely clear that the things I am about to mention are minor details, simply little things that I found frustrating and silly. These should not put you off a purchase, or make you think any less of the game. They are things that I simply could not bring myself to leave out of the review.First off then, the thing that absolutely griped me the most. Candles. Yes, you read correctly, candles. Basically they added a mechanic in which you can light candles by pressing ‘A’. Unfortunately, every other button to interact with anything, is also ‘A’. Oh, and there are candles EVERYWHERE. This makes it unnecessarily frustrating when trying to interact with objects and people in buildings, when Geralt is simply standing there lighting and extinguishing candles until his heart content.Secondly, and on a very similar note to above, is that interacting with objects just seems harder than it should be. For example using ladders, or opening doors. Again, you must press ‘A’, however it seems as though you have to stand in such a precise spot, and face in such a precise direction before you are able to complete the action. Again, this could very much be to do with that fact that I was playing on the Xbox One, perhaps the keyboard and mouse configuration is much easier to use.This one is something I feel pretty strongly about. A lot of games don’t give the player much of a say in how the game goes. Just throwing one out there as an example, the Call of Duty series (campaign). You are very much just working your way along a fixed rail, doing as you’re told and have no say in what you do next. Well Witcher allows you to make decisions! You can choose what Geralt says, changing the way characters react and what they think of you, therefore changing what happens along the storyline! Or can you? It does give you options, however, it seems that no matter what option you choose you will inevitably end up doing whatever the game wants you to do anyway… It’s as though you are still on the classic fixed rail, just working your way through the game and the ‘options’ mean absolutely nothing. On top of this, sometimes the most important decisions you need to make, are on a timer. They force you to make a quick decision and put you on the spot, to put you in Geralt’s shoes, understandably. However, when pressing my response well before the timer had expired, it would take some time to process my response and it would be ignored. Instead, Geralt simply stands there with no response, leaving me with an awkward silence, but worse, the outcome I didn’t want!And finally… All games have their glitches, that is to be expected, but I certainly found some entertaining ones in my time playing The Witcher 3. I’m pleased to say none of them were game-breaking. I didn’t die due to any glitches, or get stuck in an area that I shouldn’t have been in, they were all simply cosmetic glitches. I am always sympathetic when it comes to glitches, as it is almost impossible for a developer to iron out every single crease in the game, and let’s be honest, glitches can lead to some pretty good laughs.You’ll be relieved to know that the rant is over. I have complained about every minor detail that I wish to complain about, and it is time for me to sum up everything that I have found.To summarise…The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a game that I believe to be absolutely outstanding. Visually, it is so pleasing. I am one to agree that graphics are not everything in a game, and some of the best games out there have shocking graphics, however, when a game like this comes along that is such a joy to look at it is so refreshing. The storyline is fun and compelling. I am constantly wanting to play more and filled with sadness now that it is over. I absolutely will be playing again and working my way through the mountains of side quests and activities and becoming a Gwent champion! Geralt is the best protagonist I have ever played with, even in my opinion, trumping MasterChief… Yes, I said it. His love life is more complicated than the mind can perceive and he has the world on his shoulders, yet he still has enough time for the odd game of cards.The thing I love about this game the most, is by far it’s value for money. Games these days are so shockingly expensive, that you want to be able to play it for a good amount of time without being bored. The Witcher 3 achieves exactly that. It is rather frustrating that I had to abolish the majority of the side quests in order to continue with the ending of the main quests, however, when I replay this game, I will take that into consideration, and complete the side quests before moving on.Of course, there were a lot of little things that annoyed me such as the infamous candles, and a lot of little glitches to make the game seem a little less professional than it really is. However I feel as though I can brush these aside for what is a truly amazing game.All things considered then, I am ready for my final ratings…Graphics/Sound: 8/10Character control: 5/10Storyline/Quests: 10/10Overall Rating: 9/10I hope this review has helped aid your opinion of this game. I would love to hear your thoughts on my first review so please feel free to review my review in the comment section, and I look forward to improving upon my next review. » Until next time «",

    "review_description": "The Witcher 3 is not perfect. The pre-patches game had many technical oddities and difficulties. The combat becomes relatively rote after awhile. Breasts are displayed with reckless abandon, mostly not during sex.  Roach can be a finicky horse. Some narrative threads seem to cut off early. The UI was a chore pre-patch and is now a bit better. And while all of that matters, it's still a deeply engaging and thoughtful game built around contextualized movement through an interesting and detailed world. The main questline follows a theme of family and loyalty through to ends both political and philosophical. The game is always trying to be about something bigger--about prejudice, about responsibility, about power, about love--and it usually deals with heavy issues well. Any written questline has taken considerate thought about WHY characters are acting like they are acting, focusing on the reasoning and the motivations and the emotions over the HOW or WHAT of lore or plot. The lore and plot are good, but the characters of this world define it and make it shine. In microcosm, what I like most about this game is little moments of breathing room that amply fill around the bombast. Decapitations and disintegrations and explosions abound, but in between there are many moments of peace and reflection that make it all worth it. The writers understand that we need to care about these people in order to shove them through the next story beat, so a friendly horse race or card game or talk about the future or the past all matter just as much as making the sword go through a guy real nice. The Witcher is also intelligent about its use of choice. Geralt is a defined character. He is not a blank slate that can either save a village or burn it to the ground. Instead, his choices, while sometimes wide sweeping, focus on lesser evils and greater goods. He can, at most, be a dismissive dick. He will not torture or murder (though killing in self-defense is common). Embodying a character like this is joyful because it feels more like filling a role than creating one. The choices have more weight because they feel less arbitrary. The best parts of the game are the talky bits, I think. These are followed closely by the world exploration. Temeria is gorgeous, whether it's a swamp or a castle built into a rocky mountain. The lighting sparkles on the water and through the waving grain. Open world jank is very rare, with most the time spent in admiration rather than judgment. This is the best world I've ever seen constructed, and it is a joy to explore. The most lasting feeling for me from this game is admiration at the thoughtfulness of it all. But there are also missteps. They work together to form an awkward whole at times. For instance, minor spoilers, the mini-stories with Ciri, Geralt's pseudo-magic daughter, are sometimes brilliant. Putting the player into Ciri's shoes means creating empathy for the main thrust of the story, making us feel like her choices and beliefs matter instead of leaving her just a macguffin for Geralt to find. And there's a scene in a bathhouse that both does that and feels a bit skeevy. Textually, Ciri is learning about island culture and family and that a young man has a crush on her from a younger and older woman. It's one of the only moments between only women in the game, and their conversation feels different from political upheavals and other such matters while still feeling relevant and important. And at the same time they are nearly naked in a sauna and the player can choose to have Ciri be so as well. It's a hard balance between making a scene about emotional wellness and growth, but having this aspect of titillation and leery camera movement. The elderly woman being included shows an inclusiveness, but the women splayed out in seductive poses in the outer bath feels exploitative. It's complicated.The whole game is complicated. Describing what it is and what it isn't, what is good or bad, is difficult. Overall, it's an astonishing achievement in character and world building, with choices that matter and characters given room to be interesting rather than merely exciting. There's vampires and werewolves and elven prophesies. And there's beautiful, haunting songs played on lyres, Troll riddles, drinking parties, and deciding between a life of power or a life of wandering. The brooding gravitas and playful musing somehow work together to form a game worthy of what, for me, has been many months of slow and lovely progress. It is constantly willing to tackle social, emotional, and political issues with care, and I hope this instinct, and the fact that there are missteps, will lead to even greater stories and games in the future.",

    "review_description": "\"Developers at CD Projekt Red have created what very well may be the most realized world I’ve ever experienced in a video game.\"Ladies and gentleman, after 85 hours of monster-slaying, gwent-dealing, sword-clashing fun, I’ve decided it’s time to write what may very well be the most bittersweet review I’ve ever written. On the one hand, I couldn’t be more excited to write a review on what very well may be my favorite game of all time. On the other hand however, words can’t express how sad I am knowing that I’ll never be able to experience the Witcher 3 for the first time again. It will always be great fun to go back to, but the novelty of the unknown will have worn off. But you guys didn’t come here to read my internal struggles. No- you came here to figure out whether the Witcher 3 is something you should play in your lifetime.The Witcher 3 is story-driven RPG and there’s no two ways about it. Let me put this bluntly - if you haven’t the slightest care in the world for stories in video games then stop reading this review immediately and find another game to play. If, however, you possess an attention span that exceed that of a goldfish and are looking for a captivating story that spans continents, time, and a plethora of characters then carry on. We start in a little village located in White Orchard. It’s the quaintest of villages you ever could lay eyes on - that is, if it weren’t for the human-slaughtering griffon that’s wreaking havoc on its residents. Geralt and Vesemir (one of his fellow Witcher companions) aren’t here for the griffon, they are here for Geralt’s long lost love - Yennifer. Yet Geralt and Vesemir fall into the grasp of the griffon’s destiny, and hope they may somehow find their woman without being entangled in the monster’s claws. Its scenarios like this that make the Witcher 3 sprawl on for hours and hours, however it never feels dull. You’re often carrying out quests that have you scratching your head wondering “How in the hell does this get me what I need?” Keep in mind - that is not necessarily a bad thing though. The quests never feel dull, they aren’t fetch-heavy (ahem - looking at you Dragon Age Inquisition), and they always introduce new, charming characters that keep the game engaging.Don't worry Geralt...we've all been there after a wild Saturday night.For those that are worried about the engagement (or lack thereof) from Geralt’s character, I ask you this - give it time. He is dull, monotonous, emotionless, and stiff. Those familiar with the Witcher novels will know that those are intentional character designs by CD Projekt Red. He is supposed to be a morally ambiguous and heartless monster slayer. As you play the game, you’ll find yourself appreciating Geralt’s lifelessness when juxtaposed with the outlandish, foul, and bold antics of the games other characters. That is by no means saying that the game’s characters and world are unbelievable though. Developers at CD Projekt Red have created what very well may be the most realized world I’ve ever experienced in a video game. It’s all fantasy of course, but hypothetically, if the assets in this world did exist, this is what they would look like. Take the Crones for instance - three witches that live deep, deep in the swampy woods of Crookback Bog. I know, I know, fantastical witches such as these ones don’t exist in our world, but if they did, this is most certainly what they would look like.It’s more than just the characters that make this world so believable though. CD Projekt Red have included the smallest little details to help bring Geralt’s world to life. The trees will bend and sway in the wind. Geralt’s armor will drip with rain on a stormy night. Puddles will form on the dirt paths when a heavy rain falls. It is, in every sense of the phrase, a living, breathing, world. There were times where I caught myself taking a break from controlling Geralt and instead soaking in the view for 10 seconds. And keep in mind, this isn’t some small world that CD Projekt Red has brought to life mind you. Nope - this world is (excuse my language) FUCKING MASSIVE! Beyond this, CD Projekt Red has filled this map with interesting architecture, fun side quests, awesome treasure troves, and oh-so much more. And while I know this may be hard for some of you, I highly suggest turning off the GPS route on the game’s minimap - just trust me on this. For the first 10 hours of play I found myself wandering through this world without really remembering the various buildings, towns, nook and crannies of Velen and its surrounding continents. As soon as the guide was turned off though, I learned the map surprisingly quick. CD Projekt Red has done a good job of making unique villages and towns that help serve as more than just eye candy, but as route markers as well.\"There were times where I caught myself taking a break from controlling Geralt and instead soaking in the view for 10 seconds.\"With all that in mind, I cannot write an honest review without pointing out the game’s setbacks as well. For such a massive open-world game it's bound to have its bugs, oversights, and jankiness. From a technical standpoint, the animations and texture pop ins can vary from minor to atrocious. There is, for instance, a scene where two characters are “eating” at a dinner table. They comically slap their hands against their face (who needs utensils), yet no food is in their hand. They continue to scoop invisible soup from their bowls and slosh it into their mouths for a few seconds before cutting to a new scene. Another scene involved Geralt getting a beard shave, yet no beard or even his skin in general was properly loaded. It was just a skinless, jawless, alien impersonating Geralt.Furthermore, those that weren’t a fan of the Witcher 2’s movement, controls, and combat system won’t find themselves in a very different place while playing the Witcher 3. Geralt has a slightly delay when turning, which leads to jars and plates crashing against walls when you’re navigating through tight spaces and hallways. Roach is no different. I can’t tell you how many times I ran past my destination only to get stuck against a wall, fence, or some poor, innocent, unsuspecting child. While it’s worth noting that CD Projekt Red has developed a ginormous patch that will offer an entirely new method of movement, I can’t help but knock this game for its obvious shortcomings in the controlling department (don’t even get me started on the swimming in this game).Others may view this as 'more of the same, just bigger' when compared to Witcher 2. Others however (myself included), may consider this nothing short of a masterpiece. Unfortunately, with its technical downfalls, I’m not sure I can objectively call this a perfect game. Taking a page out of a fellow friend's book, I might categorize this as my favorite game of all time, yet you will never hear me call it the best game of all time. Those types of games need to be perfect in every aspect - including the technical parts.(Note, since Giantbomb limits .5 point scores, I will give this a 5/5. Ideally it would be a 4.5)",

The writing was great, I felt that almost all of the side quests were very good and the overall story was great. There is a good deal of character depth to the majority of the main characters that really makes you feel for them. I must say that I am a little sad that this game didn't get more love from the GB team  during game of the year when it released but it is very long, I clocked in at around 170 hours with base game and Hearts of Stone. That's a lot of time to commit for reviewers. I will be moving on to the Blood and Wine DLC which I hear is very good.",

    "review_description": "A game everyone who played was talking so greatly about and took me around a year and a half after release to finally play it. It was sensational. The story is so dense and with so much content on every part of the world. Everybody having a unique personality, it's kind of scary to think of how much work CD Projekt managed to put on the NPC's. The only thing I dislike about the game when I was playing it, especially comparing it to Witcher 2, was the combat, becoming easy and happening too many times. I find myself avoiding monsters in the world because I was like \"oh, not this guys again\", and just running with Roach.The thing that put the game over the ramp was how much they made us love Ciri. And the Blood and Wine DLC. I might argue that it's better than the main game, and the combat gets harder and with increasing variety, you have decent time between each combat on the history missions, which makes them exciting again. Just like on the second game on the series. The world on Blood and Wine was so beautiful and colorful. The people were gorgeous and with so much to get involved in.(How can you not love Anna Henrietta?)Geralt will be one of the most remarkable characters in gaming history when we look back a few years from now.",

    "review_description": "Since The Witcher series is based on a series of books by Andrzej Sapkowski the game already has well-developed lore to explore and cherry pick from to create a narrative based game that, for lack of a better phrase, does feel like you're playing a great fantasy novel.Though this game was released worldwide in May 2015 and despite me pre-ordering it on the PSN store I didn't get around to playing it till August 2016 when I was two weeks vacation from work and poured myself into the game, spending easily eight to ten hours a day playing it for twelve days straight. The first time I've really got lost in a game since playing games on the PS2. So most of the performance issues I heard about when the game launched were thankfully patched out by then. Please note that this review is only on the main game itself, I will review the two DLC add on's separately.You play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher, who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt: an otherworldly force determined to capture and use her powers.While the main story quest is engrossing, the Witcher 3's real trump card is how amazing the side quests are. While most games will use side quests purely as a way to gain experience points or get a rare item. The Witcher 3 uses them to world build and introduce you to fascinating side characters. From taking part in bare-knuckle boxing, racing horses to finding a lost goat, it's these side quests that really make the game stand out. I do feel most developers have used side quests in the past to pad out their games and make them feel bigger than they actually are.Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver). The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters. Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow and strong. Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords. Though swords do have limited endurance and require regular repair, so always keep an eye out for a sharping stone or blacksmith.In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen. Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective shield. The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely. Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's magic power. They lose health when they are attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health loss. Health can be restored with meditation or consumables, such as food and potions.And then there is Gwent, The Witcher 3's mini card game that proved so popular that it has since received a standalone release. I'm not the biggest fan of card games so I didn't spend a whole lot playing Gwent. It is something that I now regret and I do plan to give it the play through it deserves when I play this again as a New Game+. I think I was just so caught up in the narrative that I didn't want to stop and play cards. Now that I have played through the narrative I will take the time to properly learn Gwent.I've never felt so connected and like I had so much power over a virtual world before. The dilemmas are some of the best in the series. You have plenty of ways to solve them, like brute force, doing favours, and using Witcher powers, but I never felt judged for any of my choices. Nor did I ever feel that the game was trying to handhold me down a specific narrative path. While most of the quests do feel like information fetch quests, i.e. Geralt does some a favour to get information about Ciri's location, it never feels repetitive as a gameplay mechanic.It’s not easy to articulate just how huge and open this world is: beautiful lush green rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, flimsy townships/villages where people struggle to survive. There is a full day/night cycle and beautiful dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing The Witcher 3’s landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever played in.When it comes to graphics the fidelity matters less here than the scale does. As storms approach, and gales rustle and bend tree branches, and as the deer's run for cover, it’s hard to dispute this is a gorgeous game. The lighting and weather effects are breathtaking. It’s difficult to resist stopping to stare into the distance at times, especially at sunset.One of the reasons games are such an amazing medium of narrative storytelling lies in their ability to prompt stimuli in players to manipulate their mental states and make them vulnerable to emotive situations. The Witcher truly sets itself apart from other RPG's is the voice acting, yes studio's like Bethesda, Obsidian Entertainment, BioWare, Naughty Dog and Quantic Dreams have done great voice acting in games; but for such a fantastical world all the speaking roles (even small side characters) felt grounded in a believable reality, from different accents, to use of language by people of different social classes. These small little details are what add to a world and build it in a way that really draws the player in on a subconscious level.This game is scored beautifully by Marcin Przybylowicz (who scored a few cues for the second game) and Mikolai Stroinski, who you might know from The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter, which also had a pretty good score. One of the reasons The Witcher 3 achieves pure gaming immersion is by making most of its sounds diegetic. For example, when Geralt walks into a bar, the non-diegetic soundtrack fades into the diegetic soundtrack being played by the in-house musicians, seamlessly altering the mood of the game.When I did finish the main game after about two weeks of playing, I did find it hard to get into another game. As if the game gave me gamers fatigue as a way to make me stop and think about I had just played and experienced. Because of this, I waited two months before I play the first DLC add-on and a further three months after completing that to play the second DLC add-on. I would play small indie games in-between as a way to cleanse my gaming pallet.This is a must own game for any RPG fan and one that shouldn't be looked over. If you're still having doubts about buying this game, then do your research and you will realise what everyone else has already told you. It's a must play of this generation and the finest example of what RPG's can do.",

    "review_description": "RDR2 is collection of great elements and few major parts that bring the whole thing down to a level where it should not be. Polish of the game is heavily directed towards the visual aspects of the game, while everything related to game play feels like rusted relics of the past. There are just too many weird decision about the game play that I cant list them all.There is much more to be said about the controls and most of it is not good. Like for example fist fighting might as well be canned animations because so little it seems to matter what you do with the controller. Everything is animation prioritized and feels clunky. Biggest culprits here are looting and horse hitching animations. I think when I had finished the games 2nd and final epilogue, I had spent at least 30 minutes of the game time just spinning the horse in order for the hitching animation to start.Take your time to interact with various characters of the game. Unpolished game play really starts to hurt the immersion and ambiance of the game in the long run. This is not helped by the fact that later missions become what seems to be endless waves of dudes that you have to shoot in the face. So your are left with no choice but use clunky aiming mechanics, combined with heavy aim bloom, to shoot bad guys by the wagon load. I think Rockstar purposely left GTA style statistics from this game because accounted few thousand kills do not fit the redemption arc of the story that well.However side activities seem to be much better fit for the game play than shooting that you do in most of the story missions. Fishing and hunting are two biggest highlights as both are enjoyable game play wise and fit the whole western thing very well. Other things like poker, black jack and dominoes are fine but suffer from slowness as everything has to be animated to the tiniest detail.Main mission start to feel really repetitive in the end. Ride-follow-shoot-maybe ride. There is no kind of freedom how you approach these mission, except in few cases, but at these points I didn’t even consider that as option and just did what previous missions had thought me. This formulaic repetition also creeps in to the “random” stranger missions that lose that dynamic feel as the game goes on.There is beauty here but don't take too much time looking at it because Rockstar will unimmersively give you bad mission grade for not hitting hitting the par time. The story offers a great ride up to the point and has a good, poignant end in it’s sight. However it misses that and goes for drawn out 2 part epilogue that just lacks everything good that that the main story has. Also the game really hammers the ending home from early on and with a heavy hand.SpoilersSpoilersSpoilers [Spoilers:] For players it is pretty clear from early on that your main character Arthur will die. Players that know anything about RDR1 also will guess correctly that at some point of the game you take control of some other character. Since John Marston is in the game and the flip side of the map that comes with the game has the territory of RDR1, it is not hard to figure out who that someone is. Choosing Marston feels like an uninspired choice. First of all, everybody saw that coming and second, he was just not as interesting character as Arthur, Sadie or Charles. Spoilers EndSpoilers EndSpoilers End If Rockstar had the guts to just give the main story a proper ending and leave it at that, I feel like whole story would have been way more impactful. So, it seem like there is a lot of bad things to say about RDR2 and that is the truth. However it does lot right and in such a perfect way that it is hard to describe. So, if masterful western ambiance is your thing, RDR2 offers you a gigantic load of it - maybe even too much. If proper game play is your thing, you might feel this to be somewhat over rated game.",

    "review_description": " If I had to describe Red Dead Redemption 2 in one word, it would be dense. This game is jam-packed with so many systems and things to do, that it can honestly be overwhelming at times. From big things like story missions and train robberies to smaller things like landscape photography, Red Dead Redemption 2 is vast in both scale and scope. Serving as a prequel to 2010’s Red Dead Redemption, this game has you playing as Arthur Morgan, the right-hand man in the Dutch Van Der Linde outlaw gang. The game opens with the gang on the run after a failed heist and finds them trapped on a mountain during a blizzard. Once this lengthy introductory tutorial chapter is finished the game opens up and the true breadth is on display.As I said before, Red Dead Redemption 2 is dense. There are so many layers to each of the things you can do in the game. On top of the narrative missions, activities such as fishing, hunting, gambling, and a few others are available to do at any time and each has their own intricacies that make for shockingly deep experiences in each activity. For fishing, there are multiple types of lures and baits that attract different fish depending on what type of water body you are attempting to catch fish from. For hunting, there are specific weapon types that you can use to get the highest quality pelts from animals and the necessary weapon type is different for every one of the 100+ animals in the game. For both of these, there are entire economic and gameplay aspects in the selling of high-quality fish, pelts, and meat, or by saving those to use for both crafting and cooking to provide various bonuses for Arthur’s stats. All of these systems lead to one of the few games that I can think of where you could role play as a fisherman or hunter and have a fun and profitable time doing so.This level of density isn't just relegated to side activities either. In the moment to moment gameplay, there are three stat cores that need to be managed; health, stamina, and dead eye. As you use these abilities, either by taking damage, sprinting, or using dead eye, respectively, the core and meter outside the circle both drain. The fullness of the core affects the rate at which the meter refills. Every consumable item in the game impacts the three cores in various ways. Food will fill all cores to varying degrees, cigars and cigarettes will fill dead eye at the cost of stamina. There is an entire dense system with these cores that sounds like a ton of busy work, but they really aren’t. It’s more of a fill as needed sort of thing as you really never need to go out of the way to manage those things like you would in a traditional survival game. I don’t have any criticisms of the cores system, but I don’t really have much in the way of positives either. They’re just kind of there.But there are a few other things I do have criticisms for. One of the most obvious issues from the very start is the deliberate animations. Even though I eventually got used to them, every once in a while issues would arise. One specific example is when I was fishing and I noticed a group of bounty hunters rapidly approaching my location. By the time I was able to retract my line, put the rod away, and pull out a weapon, I was already being shot at. While I was able to make it out of that situation, the slow animations made it a closer call than it had any right being. As much of an issue as that can be, it is a small complaint compared to the two major issues I had with my 75+ hours with the game. In Red Dead Redemption 2, there are around 107 story missions. If I had to guess, I would say around 90+ of them were the same ride to a place, have a big shootout, then either ride somewhere else or be left miles away from the next mission marker. Repetitive mission structure has been an issue with every one of Rockstar’s past games, although GTA V was at least good at hiding it. As much as I loved riding around the world fishing, hunting, and photographing the environment, I still always wanted to see where the story would go and how it got there. Then I would do a few missions that were the standard structure I mentioned above. With as good as the story gets in later chapters, it’s a shame that Rockstar still relied on the same exact mission type for most of it. At a certain point, it just felt like I was headshotting dudes on autopilot until the next cutscene started. As I said this is sort of true for most of Rockstar’s games, but in this game it is especially grating because of my other major criticism. Half of this game doesn’t need to exist. Of the 107 missions in this game, 75 or more of them could have been cut entirely and I never would have noticed. The entire first half of chapter 5, which to be fair is a cool diversion, could be removed and the game would be no different. If the entire first part of the epilogue were relegated to cutscenes, I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more than when I was doing menial labor for hours. As much as the high points of this game stand out, there is no denying that it would be much better if someone took a knife to it and took out a bunch of the unnecessary parts. Despite my criticisms, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an achievement is so many ways. The world is such a joy to explore and there are so many activities that all have their own dense layers of mechanics, that it felt like I was having just as much fun fishing and photographing landscapes as I was robbing trains and getting into massive shootouts. The characters in the gang are so well realized and feel so real that I found myself hanging out at camp just listening to their tales and songs for hours on end. The story is so engrossing that by the end of the game I was rushing back to the mission markers just so I could see what happened next. With everything this game does well- which is a lot- it’s a shame that the things it does poorly negatively impact such a large portion of it.For the past few months, I’ve been looking for a game in which I could lose myself. Red Dead Redemption 2 not only provides me that experience, it also provided me with maybe the best chill out activities I can think of. If I’m having a bad day or life is taking its toll on me, turning on this game just to go fishing or hunting allows me to just relax for a while. Riding around the game’s gorgeous world has reinvigorated my love of landscape photography, and allows me to go on a photography adventure without having to drive a long way to do so. I could sit here and complain about the design decisions of this game until I fall asleep, then complain some more, but at its core, this game is about freedom. Freedom to ride around taking pictures of pretty waterfalls, freedom to fish and hunt, freedom to rob trains, freedom to hogtie people and throw them off a cliff, freedom to do missions or not do them as I wished. The mission structure of this game may not be great, but there is so much to it beyond missions, that I will keep coming back to this game long past the credits screen. And there are very few games I can truly say that about. Thanks for reading.Likes: Breathtakingly gorgeous visuals, engrossing story, #contentDislikes: Mission Structure is repetitive, deliberate animations can sometimes be an issue, half of the game doesn’t need to exist, ",

    "review_description": "The second Red Dead Redemption might be the hardest game to talk about. Because it's so impressive, the production value, the dept, the performances, the game just looks amazing. But it doesn't have the best controls, or one of the best gameplays, while sometimes is too slow or repetitive. But still, the story of Arthur Morgan is one that will be remembered for the ages.I love how Rockstar made us feel that the story arc in the game is personal, they give some characters with big personalities, you'll probably finish the game having characters that you really love and some that you really hate. Not to mention that Arthur Morgan is one of the best protagonists of all-time, top 2 for me. Even tho the game makes it feel like each Arthur is different, your Arthur will not have the same clothes, hair, facial hair or make the same decisions as the Arthur I'm playing as. And this feeling of the game being personal is what enhances it, and grabs you to stay put through a long journey.If you played the first Red Dead Redemption, you have an idea on how the story in this game is gonna pan out. But they cleverly still surprise the player. It was awesome to finally see the arcs of the famous characters from the Van der Linde gang that survived the bad days, as well as get introduced to a few new ones, that ended up being the most iconic in the game. I loved Charles, he's one of the best side characters ever. I didn't care that much for Sadie Adler, didn't like how over the top she was, with that voice of anger, but I can see many people loving her character. I'm not even gonna mention the characters I hate not to spoil it.It might be the deepest open world game ever made, there's so much detail and an incredible sense of atmosphere. You can create your own story just roaming around, you can find someone looking for help or maybe looking for trouble, and based on your decisions you go from there. Doing the story missions is just a small part of the RDR2 world. The soundtrack gives the game even more life, specially before some big thing is about to happen. And the game might have the best storms and the best animals I've ever seen in any video game.What I didn't like as much? Well, they over complicated with a few systems, like the Health, Stamina and Dead Eye, I'll bet that 80%+ of people will finish the game and still don't understand what the hell those cores and circle bars meant. The money is kind of unbalanced, in part of the game you feel desperate that you don't have any, but then for most part of the game you have so much and there's nothing to do with it, the game doesn't give you any insentive to become rich and hunt for all the best animals. It doesn't change the economy, the story or your stats. You can just craft some clothes for a visual change. The game also makes you lose weight if you don't eat regularly, but it doesn't have any reminder of that, Arthur never shows he's hungry, or you recover the cores just by sleeping, and suddenly \"oh you're at your minimum weight\", what!? The mission design could be a bit better also, I think they felt insecure in some parts that they needed to end most of the missions with action, and didn't want to leave any mission to just be a quick story bit, or just an stealth escape or break in. Not sure if the reason is to increase the game time or just don't feel like it wouldn't be a good enough mission, they all need some crazy action I guess. And the number one complain for most people is how slow the game is, sometimes, and they force it on the player, I didn't mind that, just once or twice that I felt it could've been faster, not that big of a deal.Despite that, RDR2 is probably the most impressive game I've ever seen, with one of the best worlds to live in and have your own story, by your own paths and decisions, and I think the game will be remembered very fondly. As one of the best games ever, but a very divisive one, because not everybody has patience with some of it's flaws.",

    "review_description": " Red Dead Redemption 2 despite its name is actually a prequel to Red Dead Redemption, which come to think of it is one of the main reasons in which we decided to purchase the game, as we have never played any of the Red Dead Redemption titles, prior to this one of course. It is a Western style action game that has the main protagonist living life as a typical Outlaw in a rather vast open world.Whilst the story is rather fun and unique, it does however take a while to get interesting and for the most part we unfortunately found a lot of it boring.A lot of the start of the story requires you to fetch certain items and the more fun missions are very few and far between. However, once the story does pick up the game overall does become much more fun to play.We enjoyed the whole mechanic of having to look after your horse allowing you to care for its health cores and making sure it remains in top condition, there is also a Horse 'Trust' meter which unlocks more abilities for your trusty steed as the level increases.There are many different optional side missions that can be completed too, alongside different mini-games and a challenge system for extra replayability.However, just as a word of warning there are several miss-able quests and other opportunities, unfortunately we where not aware of this and it did end up becoming rather frustrating to later realise this when it was too late.So if your the type to enjoy trying to complete everything in a game be sure to be well clued up on certain things before hand.We also enjoyed the ability to hunt and track down different animals which can then be used to either sell or cook.The whole having to keep low and making sure that our prey was not going to escape added great realism to the game and helped in our overall enjoyment.The combat system is rather fun and easy enough to understand, there are also many different weapons to chose from and all have their unique benefits whilst out in combat.As well as that every weapon has been deemed customisable too, from adding different handles, colours and many other nice features to make you feel like that complete ultimate outlaw!A lot of the different features that are often seen in Western style shows are also seen in this game, such as the ability to heard animals as well as capture them. As well as the style of clothing and particular accents that are often seen and heard.The overall realism makes for a very positive experience. In fact the realism is what makes us really enjoy this title, as the amount of detail is beyond anything I ever expected to find in a game.OVERALL:If your looking for a good Western style Cowboy game with a ton of realistic features and more side content than you could ever possible dream of, then this game is probably the one for you!However, as a word of warning the game does start of really slow and for anyone new to the series, the mechanics and controls may be somewhat confusing too, but with patience you will probably get used to it and realise just how good of a game this one really is!Also, unfortunately we cannot comment on the online play as it sadly does not interest us. However, going from word of friends it doesn't seem that great anyway at present, their words being that it features a system where other players can run and gun you down without any real issue and there is a lack of content compared to the offline mode. So with that take their word as you will.PROS:+ Western style games are very rare in the gaming world and thus it made for a rather unique and different experience.+ There are many different optional content to complete if one wishes to do so.+ The realism makes for a great overall experience and manages to capture the whole Cowboy Western feeling very well.+ The ability to care for your horse was a nice feature, allowing for more abilities to be unlocked helped in the overall replayability.+ The ability to chose different dialogue options during certain conversations was a nice added feature too.CONS:+ The story took a while to become interesting, often plagued with too many missions that felt very similar to the last.+ Apart from one or two of the characters, for the most part the cast just seemed uninteresting and we never found ourselves caring for them.+ In order to get 100% in the game you need to complete various different tasks in Online play, which is not for everyone.+ A lot of the story left us with more questions than answers, the story overall was very average.+ Some of the content in order to achieve 100% is miss-able, thus frustrating if you did not know this prior to playing the game.+ Also, on a personal note. There was no option to romance Dutch, a fangirl needs her husbandos even if it looked rather different in-game.Main Story Length: 50 - 60 HoursPlatinum Trophy Length: 80 - 100 Hours",

    "review_description": "The sequel that is a prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2 takes place in the time line before the story of the much revered Red Dead Redemption. The main story is based around the adventures of Arthur Morgan as we works as the second hand man of Dutch van der Linde. The Van der Linde gang finds itself on hard times and running from an attempted score in the town of Blackwater that went awry. Living much as nomads, the gang must keep moving to avoid the law and Pinkertons. As they move they must also try to make a living by either doing good or bad things.Having only played less than five hours of the original Red Dead Redemption and without a nostalgia for that game this game was a new experience to me for the most part. There were things about this game that I really loved and enjoyed. Conversely, the things I dislike about the game I came to loathe and those things truly tainted my thoughts and feelings about the overall game.Things I Liked...The game is beautiful on a technical level. I played on a launch edition of the Xbox One and there were issues of draw-in of objects but all-in-all the game is still gorgeous. Everywhere you look there is something detailed and amazing. Look up to the sky and you could see the sun shining bright through the clouds or the twinkle of stars through a night-time drizzly haze. The draw-in issues were so minimal that it barely mattered to me but that was because everything else looked fantastic. The level of detail that the characters and environment had was astounding. Looking at a character and seeing their freckles or looking at a banister and seeing the grain of the wood gave the game a weight of realism. Then there are all the sounds. The clop of the horses, patter of the rain, clack of a gun's hammer... all made the game more immersive. Then layer the music on top of it all, marvelous.Things I Disliked...Of all the things the game did, I'm left with feeling that it just didn't respect my time. The game is wide and deep in that there are many things to do and are robustly built. That turns out to be a blessing and a curse. When I was trying to get through the story, I felt constantly inundated by side story material that I didn't necessarily want to do. I'd be trying to get to a town to do what I thought was a story mission only to get interrupted by riders approaching me then opening fire for reasons I never understand. What I did to trigger this, other than being at a place at a certain time, still eludes me. It felt as though there were just too many things to do and manage. Hunting, which I did little of... trapping(?) which I did none of(not sure this was a thing you can do or not)... strangers, there were so many I just lost interest... robberies, that I avoided doing... and the list goes on. It is great that they had all these in the game and did them well but it became overwhelming and frustrating while just trying to progress in the game. The limited fast travel system meant ride your horse most of the time to go anywhere which felt like a further misuse of time. Then there is the gun play that is horrible, frankly. It had what I can only describe as a wonk and wobble that I could find no control adjustment to make it feel much better than barely playable much less ok.When It's All Said and Done...If I were asked to rate this game... three out of five stars. Let me explain. The environment and story of this game made me want to keep playing. I loved seeing the world and going through it. There were times I wish I had the time just to go around and look. I wanted to explore but I just don't have the time. That's not a problem with the game but it became a problem with my experience with it. As well as they developed everything you can do in this game it felt like a burden at times just to move forward and disappointing to not be able to play out scenarios they present you.What makes the game for me is the story. Again, I didn't play the first game significantly and don't have that as an attachment. I found Arthur Morgan to be one of the most empathetic characters I have ever played. Going through the game, I found myself making decisions based on the thought in my head of 'I just want things to work out for this guy and it be good'. All the time knowing it would not because of the foreshadowing presented I knew what his outcome would be. ",

    "review_description": "Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of those games where you come home, boot it up, and think \"I'll just play a couple missions before going to bed.\" After countless hours of not even completing a single mission, you finally look up and it's 2 AM and you have to be at work in 6 hours. It is so realistic that it will suck you into its world and won't let go, and that immersion and attention to detail by Rockstar has both its positives and negatives.Gameplay:To simplify it entirely, the game consists of riding your horse to your mission marker, riding your horse again to the mission, shoot a bunch of people, and then ride your horse back. It's more fun than it sounds, but it definitely grows old by the end of this 100 hour game. The game is about 50 hours too long, in my opinion. There are entire chapters (looking at you Chapter 5) that could have been completely cut out of the game and wouldn't have made a bit of difference in the overall story or enjoyment of the game. The missions can be really incredible and consist of things as varied as getting super drunk and dancing on a bar or collecting fake zoo animals from around the world, but too often the game relies on the same exact mission objectives of go somewhere, shoot people, and come back. The developers showed us that they can come up with awesome ideas that are a lot of fun, but spend 80% of the game with the same exact mission objectives, which is really frustrating.This isn't to say I don't like RDR2, I really liked it in fact. The sidequests, for one, are super interesting. The characters (for the most part) are interesting and fun to get to know. The world that RockStar created is full of life, totally gorgeous, and a joy to explore. Towns especially feel real, with people going about their day with or without you being there. The attention to detail is the best I've ever seen in a video game, with mud tracks that follow you while riding a cart and how you walk into a store and can literally peruse the shelves to look for real food to eat to replenish your health. I really like how you have to manually reload your guns, and the impact that has on how you approach battles. There are no \"boss battles,\" where an enemy has more health than anyone else and you have to shoot them 100 times to win. Everyone dies just the same.RockStar went out of their way to make this game realistic, and they succeeded totally. Sometimes, however, I don't want my game to be *this* realistic. The main gripe I have is how much time you spend just...riding your horse. The game knows this and literally lets you press a button to cinematic mode where you can put your controller down while your character travels without you pushing any buttons at all. But why is this required? You will have places you have to travel that are literally 15 full minutes away and you have to either hold X the entire time or put your controller down and do something else for 15 minutes just so you can do the next mission. Why RockStar? Yes I know you can fast travel or take a train, but oftentimes you're not anywhere near a place where that's even feasible and it doesn't save any time. There is a truly insane amount of things to do in this game. Don't feel like playing a mission? Don't worry, there is a girl over there who wants to race you, a poker game over there, and a dozen animals you can go hunt. Want to go fish? Go ahead. Want to go shop for clothes and get your picture taken? Go for it. This game will keep even the most picky gamer entertained for dozens and dozens of hours. But you can also just plow through the story if you'd like and skip all of that. The controls are generally fine, but I have gripes there as well. Why would you map the button to talk to people as the same button as aiming your gun at them? Now I have a bounty on my head and I was just trying to say hello to that nice man over there. God forbid you try and speed up the glacial pace of getting around in this game and try to speed through town. Inevitably you will barely graze someone and 40 cops will go out hunting you down for assault. It's cool that the towns are immersive and interesting, and Saint Denis is downright fantastic, but some of the choices RockStar made here are just inexplicable. The shooting is hit or miss, literally, where sometimes your character will aim right away at someone and sometimes he just aims randomly into the distance and you die. And I like the slow-mo where it shows some of your best shots, but when I'm in the middle of trying to kill 30 people the last thing I need is a random slow-down in time, it throws me off what I was trying to do just to show some gory scene where a man gets shot in the face. It's unnecessary at best.Story:Now it may sound like I don't like this game based on everything I said. But the reason I really enjoyed this game and played it for 100 hours is because the story is one of the best I've ever seen in gaming. Arthur Morgan may be my new favorite main character in a game. He is nuanced, deep, and you really grow to care about him by the end of the game. He is not a black-and-white good or bad guy, and neither are most of the people in your little gang. Even Dutch, who everyone loves to hate, is a really interesting character throughout that game and it was fun to watch him go completely nuts by the end and become the person you know him as in the first RDR. Ms. Adler is another favorite character, and just sitting at camp and listening to the members fight, sing, and go about their days is really fun. Arthur grows and changes throughout the story and the whole thing is a joy to watch unfold.Obviously spoiler alert, but the one big issue I have is how long I have to sit and watch Arthur die. Jesus, did I really need 10 hours of knowing he was slowly dying? I can understand 1-2 missions, but literally 10-15 missions of this is downright painful to watch. I can appreciate how Arthur changes knowing his own death is imminent, but you can just wander off into the world of side quests and hunting and never die but it almost feels obligatory to just go get it over with by the end with all the hacking up blood Arthur is doing in the last chapter. I also didn't think the epilogue was even remotely necessary, it takes away from Arthur's story and feels like just a play for nostalgia from RDR players. I don't need to go from shooting up an entire town to picking up horse poop for several missions in a row. I think this could have just been accomplished in cut scenes, and cut at least in half. Graphics:Some of the best graphics in gaming. Gunfights look real, water looks incredible, and you can see the ripples made when you're rowing a boat through the water. Sunsets are absolutely stunning and seeing them from a mountaintop or cliff is worth just sitting and looking at for no reason other than how pretty it is. The lighting in the game is perfect, and even Arthur's guns look unique and cleaning them shows them noticeably get cleaner. Horses are also really well done, with their movements looking real and natural. Arthur's hair and beard will grow and you can get all kinds of hilarious hair cuts. The clothing you can wear is super varied and somehow all of it fits Arthur well and looks great. I can't say enough about how beautiful and immersive this game is, it's really a joy to just sit and even watch someone play this game because it's just that stunning.Soundtrack:Meh. I don't think there are a lot of standout tracks on here. The music fits well with where you are, but you will hear the same tracks over and over and over and luckily they aren't super noticeable other than the music that plays at the end, which is very good. If you want to check out the best music from the OST, try out \"See the Fire in Your Eyes,\" \"True Love,\" \"Do Not Seek Absolution,\" and \"That's the Way It Is.\"Overall, this is game that you will love/hate. It will take a ton of hours of your life, but most of them are fun and rewarding, the story is great, and if you can past the gameplay grievances you will have a great time. The fact that there are so few issues and bugs with such a huge game is actually quite impressive, and this is a game well-worth playing that I would recommend to anyone that likes pretty graphics and a great story.

    "review_description": "Red Dead Redemption 2 feels exactly how Rockstar games have felt in the past, for better or worse. Character movement is incredibly slow, shooting relies heavily on auto-aim and generally feels pretty sluggish, and you’ll have to power through some pretty lengthy chapters that feel like they drag on forever. But if you’re able to look past these dated-feeling quirks, you’ll find that Redemption 2’s plot, characters, and world building are some of the best Rockstar has ever done. Arthur Morgan is a truly great and interesting protagonist, and I wanted to see his story conclude despite having to force my way through some lengthy late-game rough patches, while trying to decipher an abundance of systems are never explained in great detail. It’s definitely one of the most cinematic games I have ever played—it’s honestly one of the best presentations the video game medium has ever seen. And that’s the most conflicting thing about Red Dead Redemption 2—everything that surrounds the plodding gameplay is so spectacular that if this were any other game, I may have stopped playing long before the credits rolled. Thanks for reading! If you'd like to see more of my mini, TL;DR reviews, feel free to visit my website.",

    "review_description": "Never before have I seen a game that can completely immerse the player into a fictional world within the first 10 mins of playing. From the stunningly, realistic graphics of the 1890’s America, to the complex yet, easy to follow story and the rugged, lifelike gameplay can make a grown man cry. Especially to be a creation from a corporation that is notorious for their lackluster effort and scummy microtransactions. It is as if a 1-star café has won best coffee award. Only once before in 2013, did Take two Interactive forget to include their greedy techniques and decided to put their attention and effort into creating a good game. Grand theft Auto V is acclaimed to be an incredible game by both players and critics. The blood, sweat and tears from the game developers at Rockstar Studios can be easily seen from the spectacular game that is Red Dead Redemption 2. Intricate and compelling storyA frequently used point people use against Red Dead Redemption 2 is that the game is boring and fails to keep the player entertained throughout the game. The only possible reason to why they would think so is if they mistook Red Dead Redemption 2 for A million ways to die in the west, a film which proved unsuccessful at the box office. Red Dead Redemption 2 allows for the ultimate wild west experience as you traverse through New Hanover and New Austin as the era of cowboys and outlaws come to an end. The Van der linde gang must survive the alternating world and try to make as much money as possible before their past actions catch up to them. In 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 was awarded ‘best narrative’ at the Game Awards. The story that Rockstar Studios developed has the player experience all the challenges and struggles of Arthur Morgan which eventually allows the game to control the players emotion like a puppet on strings. RDR2’s emotionally compelling and intricate story is a crucial reason why it is such an incredible game. Modern teachings from the pastThe morals scattered across the world of Red Dead Redemption 2 are enough to provide a life’s worth of teachings to the player. The many multiple-choice situations presented in the game allow for players to receive different consequences for their actions and allows them to rewarded for good deeds. However, sometimes what appears to be the right thing to do may end up punishing your character. One example of RDR2’s teachings is life is constantly evolving and if you don’t evolve with it, you will be left to rot. This message can be constantly found throughout the game as gangs and outlaws are quickly becoming extinct. What’s most interesting about these morals taught from the game is how they are both relevant to present day as well as the wild west setting of RDR2. It is because of games like RDR2 that show a close representation to life in the wild west, people from present day can be enlightened by these lessons without physically facing the hardships that come with. The most ironic part about the morals presented by the game is that for most players, they slip right underneath their noses without them even knowing they have gained this wisdom. Like an ignorant Prophet. RDR2 has given players a game to entertain for hours as well as learn some meaningful life lessons along the way. Life-like visuals and scoreAfter taking a good glance at the scenery and graphics of Red Dead Redemption 2, it is clear to see why this game has been so successful with critics. RDR2’s graphics are so stunning that it can be compared to life itself. Rockstar Studios captured the wild west scenery in its purest form. Then it plays, a perfectly executed accompaniment to the stunning visuals. The mere thought of this combination can put chills down any gamer’s spine. For it is the realistic visuals and music/sound effects that allow RDR2 to be considered incredible compared to games like the Far Cry and Fallout series. Not only was RDR2 nominated for ‘best art design’ at the game awards 2018, but RDR2 was also awarded with ‘best score/music’ and ‘best audio design’. The effect that the graphics and music can have on the players can increase their experience tenfold, such as if you watch a movie at home on your couch then comparing that to watching the same movie at the cinemas. It is the incredible score and visuals that have given so much prestige to the name, Red Dead Redemption 2.In Summary, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a remarkable game made by Rockstar Studios and published by Take Two Interactive that should be the first game that comes to mind when considering what game to buy next. The graphics and score of RDR2 are the most notable aspects of the game that really transcends the experience to another level. Take Two Interactive who swing and miss far too often have finally hit themselves a home run.",

    "review_description": "After having sunk around fifty or so hours in to Nier Automata I can comfortably say it is nothing short of a profound masterpiece and an astonishing example of the medium of video games at its absolute best taking all of its strengths and putting them to tremendous use, regardless of whether they formed things that were familiar or distinctly different everything was handled with so much care and clearly a tonne of passion from all aspects of the game development process involved.Dork boy and cool girl ready to murder some robuts.I would certainly say Automata is an especially unique game on top of being a really good one despite its familiar elements, which is the case to such a degree you cannot truly appreciate the full breadth of work and absolute genius put in to its creation unless you've both finished the initial story campaign twice (from the perspective of its two leads), most of its side missions and then completed the follow up story that begins on your third return to this games world.Prior to beginning my playthrough I made sure I was well up to date on the previously established fiction that serves as a backdrop to the events of Automata, primarily the previous title: Nier and its predecessors Drakengard 1, 2 and 3. Thankfully in this modern age one needn't actually play these games to experience their content and thanks to some very well done summary videos and a well handled Let'sPlay I was quite prepared to enjoy what the latest offering from Yoko Taro would entail to its fullest. While certainly having prior experience with his work will add a lot to your appreciation for certain elements of the world and story within Automata, it isn't strictly required. Though I am very glad I put in that extra \"homework\" beforehand as every little nod and reference to events, characters and items from those older games didn't go unnoticed which only added to the sheer joy I felt running through Automata again and again.Mechanically speaking the standard combat of Automata can be compared to any of Platinum Games' previous titles where incredibly satisfying melee that is easy to understand but challenging to master is their go to formula once more but a Nier game wouldn't be a Nier game without its heavy nods to traditional 2D shooter titles as well and so utilizing your floating Pod companions along with well executed sword, staff or fist weapon combos is crucial to both survival against the tougher enemies and bosses and simply appreciating the games high paced very satisfying gameplay as much as possible. That said it has a range of difficulty options available to all kinds of players with you straight up having the ability to remove every aspect of your hud and completely jump in the deep end or dramatically simplify things on easy through automating some of your combat mechanics. I played on normal most of the time and eventually bumped up to hard once I realized things were getting a little too easy which can easily be done at any point you so desire.Even just hitting the sprint button made for traversing on foot so incredibly fun, especially when it came to the wider expanse of the desert area with its sliding embankments that almost results in a dynamic sand surfing game of sorts. I do wish I didn't have to do quite so much backtracking in Automata but I was always enjoying the basic act of traversal and combat so much I never felt like things were getting especially tedious.Even your Pod has some snappy great lines of dialogue that may just make you laugh. Depending on the camera positioning and whether you are controlling your regular characters or another creature or vehicle of some kind you may at any point be playing in third person or quickly switching to a more 2D perspective the latter of which easily can be compared to the likes of classic shooter series such as Raiden or Contra. The game loves to swap between camera modes and thankfully these transitions very rarely hinder your ability to see what you're doing or where you need to go thanks to very smart level design, baring the instances where the lighting was perhaps a little too dark that your character blended in to the background perhaps a tad too much. Nonetheless I managed just fine even during those instances.At one point Automata even turns in to a fighting game, solely for a single boss fight, only to then return to normal quickly after. All of these diversions from the standard gameplay wonderfully break up the pacing and always satisfy with their distinct presentation blending old ideas so perfectly with contemporary examples in ways I really wish more games would do more often with the sheer polish on display here. No deviation from the standard gameplay over stays its welcome and manages to be quite fun despite how simple it tends to be. Even the hacking mini games here manage to be their own little side thing that I enjoyed quite a bit.On playthrough two I felt like I was at times running through an Oddworld title whenever I had an opportunity to possess an enemy and put them to use through 9S's hacking mechanic. Although I honestly did far prefer playing as 2B since I absolutely love her design and her two weapon melee fighting style is way up my alley as far as my favorite things to do in games goes.The presentation alone puts many other modern releases in regards to art direction, animation and a basic sense of good style to shame. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase any number of well made figures based on numerous character designs present in Automata. Whether its the direct and serious 2B or her dorky sidekick 9S, the quiet bad ass A2, the enormous towering first boss Engels or even the most basic and adorable fodder enemies you slaughter in the hundreds and their various larger and weirder incarnations its clear that some very talented artists did a lot to make these characters really feel special.A2, aka the other bad ass girl, perhaps even more bad ass? A strong sense of visually distinct elements really helps make the game feel like its own thing and in many respects how they are utilized feels like only a game can truly do them justice especially in the instances where you literally see the world from the perspective of a weak, clunky, slow and very vulnerable little robot compared to the sleek and crazy powerful Yorha androids.While its particular take on post apocalypse environments generally isn't too original Nier at least avoids the pitfall of being nothing but bleak empty destroyed landscapes, with the lively Disney-World inspired robot Amusement Park being perhaps at the top of locals you will remember fondly here.Story wise I obviously can't get too specific without spoiling a lot of what makes progressing through Automata so engrossing but at one point things have gone so bad that I was left with a very difficult choice in how to deal with a character I really liked a lot and it was probably one of the most heart wrenching painful things I've ever had to do in a video game. And I suspected something like this would be present in Automata eventually but I was amazed at how successful it was in getting me to feel the way I did. You just don't get that kind of thing in games the vast majority of the time, and I applaud Yoko and his crew for such a monumental achievement in interactive story telling.I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say numerous instances of Automata's story almost brought a tear to my eye. Video games simply don't do this enough, and maybe I'm just too easily swayed by some very well acted anime-like melodrama but I honestly would be shocked if anyone could play this game and not feel something for the many events that take place by the end. Yoko Taro seems to really enjoy making players feel awful (in a good way!) and he crafts his writing and direction around this end goal so well that I wish to god more game devs would take note of his approach and his methods. I desperately crave more big budget games that can elicit a wide range of emotional responses far beyond the mere act of fun.Just mindless robots right?Granted the primary story driven heavy handed guilt the game heaps on to you slowly over your actions towards enemies could have been handled with more subtlety, I nonetheless felt appropriately shitty upon realizing of course that the \"heroes\" of this game world may in fact be, if not as bad as the \"villains\", at least no less grey than they turn out to be.Nier Automata covers a lot of complex themes and concepts from the mere basic idea of unnatural sentience to whether or not artificial intelligence can be deserving of true empathy to the most basic forms of hatred and blind faith towards ones actions and beliefs being in the right despite how easily they can be proven wrong from another perspective. No one and nothing in this game world is truly heroic or truly evil and I absolutely adore that. So many story focused games could benefit from lessons learned from Automata.Finally I must mention the sheer amazing music that consistently gets utilized to fantastic effect to the point even when certain quests end on certain tones the music will reflect whatever the end result happened to be, punctuating the emotional intention on the player with that much more beautiful intensity.I simply cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed this game in so many respects. It is without question among my top ten video games of all time. It isn't perfect, no game is, but in the future if someone who doesn't play games wants to know why I love them so much this is a title I will proudly point them towards without a second of hesitation.Do NOT skip this game.",

    "review_description": "*I'm reviewing the PC version.Nier: Automata on a fundamental level is a good action game that has solid foundation of heavy and light combat system with some shooting mechanics. The adversary one faces is numerous in types and attacking patterns, scales well to your level and experience, and there are a plenty of customization options to improve your experience and tailor it to many preferences.The plot is about a couple of special combat androids fighting the robots that aliens used to invade the earth and chased away the humans to a moon colony. I found the characters dull, creepy, and little in the way of redeeming qualities overall. The story is laid thick with depressive overtones but is actually interesting and adopts an iterative process of playing the game again after the first story ends in order to get the full experience. There are times however when the action gets repetitive and a lot of recycled materials slow down the experience somewhat. Another egregious part of the game is how the narrative takes the control away from you and plunges into this indulgent meta-game aspect at the whim of game design. At first, this interjects some fresh perspective on the somewhat minimalist presentation and is appreciated. But after yet another story sequence of angst-ridden pseudo-philosophical discourse it quickly gets cringe worthy and breaks immersion. I find it also clashes with the systematic way it opted to explain away some of the technical options in the menu screen as integrated into the game character and world design. Overall, I consider this plot reveals and existential musings as reward enough for hours invested, and appreciate the effort gone into communicating to players who parted with their hard earned cash to enter into this relationship with the game willingly.Another very significant part of combat is the hacking mini-game, which takes shape of a fairly standard dual joystick shooter that allows one to burrow into robotic adversaries and, if successful, destroy them. In large portions of the game, hacking naturally becomes the primary method of attack as it is much easier to hack your way through throngs of enemies rather than hack-and-slash. Not all sessions are the same, with evolving attack patterns aspiring to a bullet hell type shooter and varied layout of the arena. But they become a tiresome chore long before they start repeating. Moreover, the mini-game always begins with a fade to white transition and becomes uncomfortably blinding to your eyes as you try to focus and react to the incoming projectiles.The world is open and is divided into gated sections that one can't access until reaching a specific point in the plot. Overall the world is fairly dull, cordoned off with invisible walls, and graphics overall are not that impressive for what is required to get a smooth playing experience out of the game. It features some reactivity, but your interaction with the open world is primarily fighting and doing boring fetch and escort quests. Exploration aspect is somewhat lacking but is incentivized by secret stashes of weapons and other non-essential perks. The music does much to lend some air of mysteriousness and poignancy to the world but some pieces feature high pitched raspy vocals and get quite overbearing after a while.There are a slew of technical problems on the PC version, and users are expected to scramble for a custom fix by themselves to play the game without stuttering or crashing. The keyboard binding is left wanting and belies the game's console roots and mouse is plagued with acceleration problems. The pre-rendered cutscenes are horrible 900p and 30 fps and take up half of the game's installation weighing at a whopping 24GB. Square Enix has not yet released one patch to fix these numerous problems but instead released an overpriced DLC in the meantime.Truly the technical problems could have been shoehorned into augmenting this meta-game aspect and I might be satisfied with the premise given this game's inherent strengths. A four star game and a recommendation, let down by technical issues.",

    "review_description": "Appearances deceive. And even though I consider myself a person that respects that trap, I never expected that beneath the surface of a videogame with high-heels and samurai swords I would come across a narrative built on robust philosophical arguments about consciousness, self-discovery, life and History. This is what happened to me in NieR Automata, the new videogame from Yoko Taro, in collaboration with Platinum Studios: after a few hours, and some plot points revealed, I started to question if I had just witnessed a very well-written conversation about some mainstays of the work of the philosopher Georg Hegel. Couldn’t be; I certainly was mistaken. I could not remember the last time I had experienced a movie or a non-academic book that tackled such subject matters. A few more hours in, I find myself facing a gigantic machine with a centipede-like design with interconnected cores. Its name: Hegel.NieR Automata’s story and subject matters are not hidden in some kind of esoteric narrative. Yoko Taro and his team have the rare courage to be very direct and descriptive about the topics they want to address. But man, doesn’t this game illustrate its message in an incredibly stylish canvas! In the first 15 minutes, you know what type of a ride this is going to be. The Music (from composer Keiichi Okabe) is immediately front and center. And deservedly so; as past works of the composer, not only it’s filled with substance and variety but also knows how to naturally transition from moment to moment. I really can’t make any justice to this phenomenal soundtrack with words: it’s not just an addition to the experience, it has its own driving power, a great force but very eloquent with amazing intuition. One aspect that caught my ear was how a different track remained “on air” after a big moment, before transitioning to another. That perfectly resonates with players’ mood after experiencing some big revelation.Then, you start to notice the level of detail of the character models and the machinery that are part of the story. All the world building feels very truthful because of this design work. Even background choices like the color palette are very well implemented, as the focus on a fewer amount of tonalities than the typical Japanese game gives Automata a distinct look, that is in line with the context the characters find themselves in. Yet, this is a deceptive minimalism. They still manage to introduce a lot of contrasts and saturated scenarios. NieR proves that beige and brown can also have style. On a different note, it should be mentioned that the game has some frame-pacing issues on a Standard PS4, but it never compromises the flow of battle encounters and it’s only prevalent in parts of the open-world with more geometry to drawn in.Despite the intentionally minimalist color palette, Automata still manages to deliver a lot of visual diversity and life. Speaking of flow, the battle encounters feel impeccably smooth. But you don’t even need to reach your first confrontation to notice how properly weighted the controls are. People who have experience with previous character-action titles from Platinum know what I am talking about. And I would argue that the level of 1-to-1 feedback between motor input on the controller and actions on the screen is so responsive and beautifully choreographed that newcomers to the genre will hardly find a better Platinum game in this regard. The combat is not as varied and challenging as some other games in the portfolio of these developers, but as new weapons and special attacks are discovered through open exploration or story directed roaming, the player finds himself with a significant amount of tools to introduce creativity on how to tackle different characteristics of the enemies. In the end, the combination of beautifully complex animations, the properly weighted pace and the on-screen coolness makes this game one of the best Platinum has ever done and I have to tip my hat to the collaboration between the martial-arts team, the motion-capture team and the animation team.So, how did they implement all that amazing art into the world and moment to moment progression you find yourself in? I stand by the following answer: NieR Automata is one of the best directed stories I have experienced in all of entertainment.Once again, first impressions are deceiving. The game starts of by stating a very simple conflict: you are in the far future, and mankind has been pushed out from Earth by machines built by aliens. The only force fighting back is a group of elite androids commissioned by humans – YoRHa. You, the player, control one of these androids: 2B is a cold, efficient and job-first soldier that is tasked to join the frontlines on Earth and to find out the reason for the recent surge in machine activity. She is equipped with two swords and a robot pod that gives advice and some suppressive firepower.Soon enough, 2B finds herself accompanied by a fellow android named 9S. This boy is quite different from 2B, not only because he asks a lot more questions before acting and also because he is more suited for long-range combat than martial-arts combos. He hacks enemy machines.Believe me, they look like Anime characters but evolve like Real ones.What starts of as a very archetypal Anime structuring, with some occasional comments on “feelings vs machines”, gradually becomes a very fulfilling story, centered on meticulously built arguments about the meaning of History, about life not being just a chain of events but a process of self-discovery, what is consciousness and, more importantly, where does it stem from. All these might read has very vague and quasi pseudo-intellectual premises that tons of other entertainment products have built their messages on, but I have read my fair share of Hegel, Nietzsche and Sartre to, at least, be comfortable saying that Yoko Taro and his team did their homework and managed to land very difficult and complex rationales into this game with incredible grace.The game is divided into 3 playthroughs. You can finish the first one and be perfectly happy with the arch you have just witnessed. And that’s part of the geniality of Automata. The first playthrough would be very strong and meaningful on its own, and it’s amazing how the second one turns the sensations you felt, by the end of the first, against you. What you felt was the result of expectations about traditional storytelling and not what this story is truly bringing to the table. After you finish the 2nd playthrough you know why you have to continue to the 3rd. It won’t disappoint.I spent around 50 hours with Automata, and they felt like a breeze. The highs and lows of the main missions are so perfectly spaced that you always know that something important is being built up and, most importantly, that it will deliver either in terms of mysteries’ revelation or on the fantastic variety in gameplay direction you are about to experience. And even many of the smaller side-missions I tackled did not feel like a chore. Many of those ended up rewarding the player with items or pieces of information that flushed-out the lore. The world is so grounded in studied ideas that you always want to know more. Oh! Have I mentioned that the combat and general movement of your character is so cool that turns the most boring mission into a super-hero journey?Another example of well thought implementation is the leveling system. Yes, I’ve mentioned that the gameplay loop is not as deep as other Platinum games, but I found that the way they chose to structure the typical skill unlocking was very conducive to experimentation and build-diversity, either within the same playthrough or for role-playing during the 3 different playthroughs. The designers decided to limit the amount of abilities you can have equipped at the same time. But with an important caveat: you can always pause the game and customize. You have a fixed number of slots for abilities’ assignment and, moreover, the stronger the ability becomes the more slots it occupies. You have 3 of these “profiles” to work with, and you can choose if you want to have 3 different strategies (built from different combinations of abilities) and change between them mid-battle, or if you want to stick with one for that playthrough and then experiment with a completely different focus (attack, defense, etc.) during the other 2 playthroughs. [MILD SPOILER!!]: Leveling and profiles carry on between playthroughs.I know there are products that are not for everyone. I don't care: everyone should play NieR Automata.By now, you know: I am ecstatic for having had the privilege of experiencing this amazing art work. This analysis would, probably, had been better served with an essay-like format where plot points and premises would be more thoroughly described and challenged, such is the strength this videogame shows on those departments. But the game has not been on the market for a reasonable amount of time and I wanted to write something that everybody could read without spoilers. I really wanted to express a lot of thoughts after finishing Automata because this game made me think a lot about ontology and other realisms. This game is really special and I am still astonished by how it manages to deal with complex philosophical inquiries and maintain a striking sense of style. More! The style is in complete coherence with the transcendental arguments being made. Sci-fi, more often than not, can’t beat that trade-off: it’s either edginess and immense sense of wonder or using machines as metaphors for humanity’s evolution, having the latter serious epistemological problems masked by big concepts filled with rhetoric.NieR Automata shows us that you don’t have to deal with the trade-off if you suggest a new, well-articulated, paradigm. If “The Matrix” was praised for teaching Plato’s Allegory of the Cave with a lot of style, Automata should be lauded for threading in much more complex ideas.",

    "review_description": " Over the years I’ve seen games that tried to take the multiple perspective angle with the story they were trying to tell. Most have done an average job at best but now a game has taken it to a whole new level. That game is named Nier Automata. Since I don’t want want to spoil any details I’ll be focusing my review on 2B's storyline. A quick set up of the story is that humans have fled to the moon after an alien invasion. They decide to build a android army to exterminate the aliens and all the machines they built to take over the earth. 2B is a fighter model that was built to take on missions to destroy any violent machine lifeforms. After being paired up with a recon model 9S they go off to save a dying world. Which sounds a lot like a standard action game storyline but the themes that come up throughout the first tale are very interesting. It may just start with the trope of machines starting to gain sentience but by the end it goes in so many directions.Machines vs Androids the age old battle. Yet are they more alike than they think? HmmThe narrative is a big part of what makes this game amazing yet the gameplay is just as compelling. The gist of the action takes place in third person action scenes with a focus on slashing through any machines that stand in 2B’s way. Like many other games this one has a light and heavy attack but where it starts to break away from the norm is the addition of the helper bot. He is always flying nearby and can shoot out bullets to take out far away enemies. Along with a special attack that can be customized in different ways. It starts out with just a giant laser beam but by the end you’ll have around 20 different ways to assist in every fight scene. Between the two it gives the player enough tools to deal with any situation and keep the fights interesting enough that they don’t become boring. Other than the camera changing up its focus to change how the player sees things the other main gameplay style is a top down bullet hell mode. Flying around blasting everything to bits is fun and it adds some variety to the gameplay.Stabbing and blasting things is great but the in between moments are just as vital. The world isn’t super huge yet it has plenty of side quests to take on. Some are the standard go here and collect stuff and then they’ll give you a reward quest. Yet most add a lot of flavor to the world you happen to be visiting. Whether it's just building a playset for some friendly robot kids or trying to understand why someone would like a snobby philosopher this world has some very interesting \"people\" in it. Wanting to see more of the world made me interested in competing just about every side quest.All machines are evil going by the fact I got this trophy. (I forgot to take some screenshots for this review.)By the time the credits starting to roll for the final time I had plenty of stuff that I enjoyed throughout my multiple playthroughs. The music and almost every character moments were enjoyable for me. But a few minor nitpicks must be brought up. For one the amount of different weapons is staggering yet none of them change up the combat in a significant way. 4 different weapon types with similar animations does not give the melee fights much variety. The same can be said about the lack of enemy types too. Like I mentioned before some of the side missions come down to running around collecting items which is never that fun. None of these nitpicks detract from my enjoyment to much but they were something I noticed during my 30 hour playthrough.In the end the journey through the desolate wasteland known as earth in Nier: Automata was fraught with many emotions. All the joy, pain, humor and suffering this story goes through hits in a way not many games do. Unless you don’t enjoy action RPG’s this is a game worth playing.",

    "review_description": " This is a beautiful game in just about every way and I highly recommend it. There are a few complaints. For people expecting a standard Platinum game, they might find the combat to be too simple, but that's a matter of perspective. This is a sequel to Nier, which was more or less styled after Zelda with its high leeway and lack of emphasis on inputs. Automata's combat fits this template and it does it admirably.Sidequests (which I recommend doing) often have you trekking through the same environments over and over. The game has multiple playable characters, but not all of them are created equal. At times you may be stuck with a character that, in spite of having dedicated mechanics, feels woefully lacking when compared to the others.The game's story is fascinating, weird, and extremely well-realized. Its themes are highly developed and worthy of thought. The emotional journey hits all its points extremely well. I will miss these characters, but I am left happily unsatisfied.Automata's PC port is godawful. I've experienced crashes and graphical errors where the game continues under an unrecoverable white screen. Without a fan-made fix, I was unable to enter full-screen mode without an odd resolution bug despite my very standard 1080p 60hz monitor. The game would max out my GPU's load and the game's framerate would slowly deteriorate over time, becoming choppy after an hour or so of play for no visibly apparent reason-- closing the game and restarting it would put the framerate back to a solid 60fps. Like many Japanese-developed PC games, it chooses to have the mouse cursor onscreen as an annoying distraction. It is asinine that Square Enix has not yet released a patch to fix any of these issues so far out of release.In spite of this, I recommend the game.",

    "review_description": "Back in 2016, I continually caught myself saying “games haven’t had a year this strong for a very, very long time.” I’m thankful to be eating these words a bit, because so far, 2017 has provided us with an even greater bounty of amazing experiences - some of which I now consider among my all-time favourites. We have games like Persona 5, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Resident Evil: 7, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Night in the Woods, PUBG, among many more - and we're only halfway through the year! I think the most noteworthy trend among these great games which has stolen my heart has been the resurgence of fantastic, weird Japanese developers. There is no question in my mind that NieR: Automata is not only the weirdest, but also the most fantastic. Please, let me share with you just some of the reasons why NieR: Automata has taken its place as my favourite all-time game.Developer PlatinumGames have a reputation which can be best described as \"mixed.\" They have games like Bayonetta, Vanquish, and Metal Gear Rising which showcase their unique blend of intense action crossed with over-the-top enemies and insane stories; but you also have utter disappointments like TMNT: Mutants In Manhattan, Star Fox: Zero, and the profoundly dreadful Legend of Korra. Thankfully, N:A was brought to us the better side of Platinum, complete with everything you could ever want from this seasoned studio. Giant set pieces with insane enemies? Yep. A deep, engaging combo-based combat system? Check. A story full of quirky, well-developed characters? It’s got that one in spades. Good Platinum is back, and they have hit the peak of their stride with this game.The combat system is simple, but fun, and engaging. Your character is adorned with a light attack, heavy attack, and a “pod” - your little robot buddy who can fire missiles/shoot bullets/pew-pew lasers at enemies, as well as provide other special moves. You have a massive selection of upgradeable weapons, and can upgrade those pods of yours too! Another interesting mechanic is the “chip” system, wherein you can upgrade your character’s hidden stats. You can add healing chips, so that you heal a percentage of your health back over time. Want a more active heal? Then you can get lifesteal stats. Want more critical hits? There’s a plugin for that. How about a sensor that reveals the location of all the hidden items onto your minimap? It has that too. There are far too many plugins to list here, but there are so many that - no matter your playstyle - you’ll find a combination which sits well with you.Gameplay doesn’t just take place in the typical 3D character action game mold, however. There are sections which split into 2D platforming, top-down bullet hells, and a hacking minigame which ends up proving both difficult and a little frustrating down the line. Overall, the game’s willingness to change itself time and time again is one of the reasons I like it so much. Often you’ll find games that try to do something drastically different from its main style of play crash and burn because of it (think The Walking Dead season 1’s shooting sequences), but one of N:A’s strengths is that all of these systems work together to create a cohesive, engaging experience.The world in which you spend your time is also a wonderful part of the experience. You spend 95% of the game in a large open world, wherein there are numerous sidequests, hidden areas, and easter eggs to be found. You will end up spending a significant amount of time in every corner of this world, so you get to know it intimately. If you have played the game, you know exactly what path to take if I say “hey, you should go from the factory to the desert.” Each area feels unique, and has its own charms. It should also be noted that each area has its own soundtrack, and boy… This soundtrack is something else.MONACA studio, as well as Keiichi Okabe knocked it twenty times beyond the park with their music. There are over 40 pieces of original music, each of which has alternate versions depending on the scenario you’re engaged with. (If you want to dive deeper into how this works, look up ‘layered soundtracks’) Not only are each of these pieces of music unique, strong as standalone music, and stylistically diverse; they each carry weight. They are emotional, and they perfectly convey what director Yoko Taro is conveying with his story. I feel that this game would not be half of the experience that it turned out to be were it not for such a spectacular soundtrack.All of these positives being said, I’m not going to say N:A is perfect. There are several things that I felt mixed about. For example, the performance/framerate on my OG PS4 was often middling (sometimes downright bad, if there is lots of vegetation). I was also not in love with the format of a number of sidequests (a few too many fetch quests for my liking). I also ended up having difficulties due to the lack of autosave on a few occasions (though, to be fair, that is more on me than the game). Truth be told, when contrasted against all of the amazing parts of N:A, these criticisms barely detract from my overall feelings on the game. I was never pushed away from the game because of any of these issues.This is the part where I should be gushing about NieR’s story, and its characters; but frankly, I’d be doing a disservice by simply running down a list of why I feel it is great. Let me put what little credibility I may have on the line by issuing a declarative statement: NieR: Automata is the most important video game I have ever played - a masterpiece. I had strong, emotional reactions to multiple parts of this game. Its storytelling flawlessly accomplishes what games like Spec Ops: The Line tried their best to do, and subverts every one of your expectations. It actively made me question my own ethics, morality, and perspectives. Not only did I feel emotional about the main plot and characters; there were also seemingly minor side characters who, when their full story was concluded, left me holding back tears. By the end of my 50-hour playthrough, I was so emotionally drained that I literally had to take a hot bath to calm my mind.As I reflect upon my time with NieR: Automata, I have an enveloping sensation of nostalgia for my first time - longing to have all of those “first experiences” again. When I reached the end of my playthrough, I was presented with a scenario where - to experience everything - I would have to replay the entire game from the very start. From 00:00:00. I did it, and I now have my first platinum trophy on PSN. I have no regrets for the time I invested, and frankly, I will gladly come back and experience it again in a few years. Another really cool thing that Yoko Taro did with the lore of this game is to not have all of it in the game. If you want the canonical ending, it is actually written into the script of their concert(s)! There is little more I would like to do than sit and talk with other people who have played N:A about their experiences, so please, if you have played N:A, send me a message - I would love to talk about this game with you.When we find ourselves looking back and talking about which game was the “game of the generation” after our current consoles fade away, NieR: Automata will sit atop my short list. I could sit here and gush for hours about why you should play this game; but, instead, I will boil this review down to one last thought: This is the game which will cement Yoko Taro’s name among the gaming greats including Hideo Kojima, and Shigeru Miyamoto. Not only that, I hold it among my favourite pieces of works across any medium - including film, television, and novels. It is the greatest showcase of the medium I can think of, and does things that only games could possibly do. I don't think it matters if you care about anime, or Japanese games in general - I feel strongly that everyone should experience NieR: Automata.",

    "review_description": " It had its moments, some better than others.In the distant future, humanity doesn’t live on Earth. It was lost long ago when aliens attacked and humanity fled to the moon. For centuries humanity has been trying to reclaim their home by sending androids to fight the machines that rule the Earth. In this never ending struggle 2B is paired with 9S. Their task is the same as all other androids, to defeat the machines so the Earth is safe for humanity once again. This task sounds simple but it has never come to pass. 2B and 9S will do everything they can to be successful but they are going to find some surprises along the way.This game is both awe inspiring and awful in so many ways. The things that it does well are brilliant and fantastic, whereas what it does poorly is absolutely dreadful. This game is very different from games I normally play and that was taken into great consideration before writing this review. It was a welcome step out of my gaming comfort zone. The consensus on the internet is that three play throughs of the game gives you the most complete version and that is where I likely will leave off. In those three play throughs, I’ve seen so many nuances that it is hard to know if I even caught all of them. Here are some of them that I did: family, obsession, unrequited love, sexuality, self realization, depression, self loathing, creationism, being a recluse, establishing a monarchy, religion, isolationism, culturalism, humanity, self image, pacifism, cannibalism, suicide, self sacrifice, and loyalty.On the surface, the game starts out being about a robot samurai lady and her partner. How this game does the story and the characters is where it really stands out. The main characters quickly go from shallow robots to deep, nearly human people. Some of the inner growth of the characters seems oddly paced, as if it is happening to quickly or unnaturally, but the pay off it gives is well done on almost all counts. How quickly the two androids become attached to each other seems awkward but the relationship becomes a pivotal point of the game. How the game is built is even part of its unique nature. When you save the game you are actually uploading your conscience and when you change abilities you are actually changing chips in your character.Stylistically the game is all over the place but in the best of ways. Jumping from third-person slasher to 2-D runner keeps the game moving and somehow invigorating. Some of the parts I enjoyed most were the 2-D shooter sequences. From a story aspect, it goes from saving humanity to falling in love and everything else possible as I’ve mentioned earlier. I don’t know how else to say it but this is a very Japanese game. It makes me feel like I spent almost forty hours playing an anime but loved every minute of it. Admittedly, the third play through was my least favorite of them. The story was intriguing but constantly jumping in between characters broke down the continuity of the game.Then there are some bad things. Graphically it is somewhat less than what can be expected on the PS4. Granted that some of the environment and characters are made they way the are from a stylistic choice but seeing grass and other parts of the environment render makes the game less enjoyable. As far as the upgrade systems, well…, not knowing where to get materials and then having to grind for them isn’t much fun to say the least. Maybe there are systems built in to aid in this but I did not find them. The worst part of the game, for me anyway, was the combat. I couldn’t get a handle on the range of weapons nor could I get the timing of the evades right. Early in the game I switched the difficulty down to easy, this removed a lot of my frustrations and allowed me to just enjoy the story.What exactly it is about this game I liked is hard to put my finger on. I know I liked the characters and the story but I’m not sure why I liked the overall game as much as I did. Given that I did not like the combat takes the game down a bit for me. Although it is still high in the running of the best games of 2017 so far. One step behind Horizon Zero Dawn but miles ahead of Mass Effect: Andromeda.",

    "review_description": " I've played some fine RPGs this year, but until now, none were compelling enough to warrant a full review. I binged on Persona 5 this spring, giving at least 120 hours of my life to another fantasy romp through modern Japan. It was definitely fun, but it wasn't groundbreaking like Persona 3 and 4 were on the PS2 10 years ago.As the summer drew to a close, I dove into Final Fantasy 15, hungry for a game I'd been waiting forever to play. It was impressive on a purely technical level, but solid real time combat and driving a shiny car around a big open world couldn't mask my disappointment in almost every other facet of the game. After 10 years in development, the story was a scattershot mess with many undeveloped characters and a very rushed ending. The soundtrack, usually one of the finest aspects of the series, was underwhelming and only really stood out during the rare occasion you performed a summon. The story telling and drama, (by my measure, the two most important aspects of an RPG) had been sacrificed on the altar of westernization. At its core, Final Fantasy was no longer an eastern RPG. It had become just another open world western style game with endless busy work sidequests, the presentation of which became the focus of the game rather than developing an intriguing plot and meaningful characters.At that point I thought maybe I was done with role playing games. Maybe the era of fascinating RPGs was over. Or maybe I was just getting old and the problem was me. Perhaps I had finally \"outgrown\" RPGs the way older folks who don't understand the appeal of videogames have been telling us we would grow out of them since we were teenagers. But then my gaze shifted to my stack of unplayed games and there was Nier: Automata.Ok Japanese role playing, you get one last chance. A final fantasy, if you will. I had played the original Nier and two out of three Drakengard games, so I had some idea of what to expect from director Yoko Taro, but I was not prepared for the masterpiece that was about to unfold.The world of Nier: Automata is Earth 9,900 years from now and it's a world drenched in melancholy. All that remains on the planet are the ruins of modern civilization and scraps of our culture that our descendant androids attempt to piece together. Conflict rages between the stoic androids and a quirky, but dangerous, robot race. The robots cartoonish looks are deceiving, for they possess a sinister collective AI that was bequeathed to them by a mysterious alien visitor. Allegedly, mankind yet survives, but whatever is left of them is safeguarded in a colony on the moon. The androids are charged with exterminating the robot menace and returning the planet to its rightful owner, their creators. \"Glory to Mankind.\"Our main charcters 2B (doesn't take long for this game to jump into philosophical musings) and 9S are thrust into this brutal situation, a merciless war in contrast with the serene beauty of a mostly deserted world. Few RPGs that I've ever played strike the masterful balance Nier: Automata does between what should be said and what's best left unsaid. In doing so, it respects the intelligence of its audience and crafts a haunting mystery that has you thinking and guessing from beginning to end.The gameplay is almost exclusively fast paced action alternating between ground combat and sections of flight based combat in mechs. Both systems are fun, engaging and easy to control. There is also a hacking mini-game that resembles old school arcade shooters, but there's only a few times during 9S' story line that they are mandatory. It's a mostly optional part of the game that allows you to hack the enemy in situations where you find it useful.The musical themes of this game will overwhelm you, likely getting stuck in your head for hours or days at a time. It does an amazing job of conveying the perplexity and desperation of the plot and of instilling in you the sense that not only has some great tragedy already occurred (even if you don't fully understand it) but that another one is yet to come.Nier: Automata has some shrug-worthy fetch quests like most RPGs, but many of the sidequests are packed with story and meaning. One example: A male and female android are on the run from their former lives, abandoning their posts and attempting to flee and start a life together away from the war. If you choose to, you can help them several times as they try to escape and begin anew. In the last stage of the quest, they have failed, having been betrayed and attacked just when they thought they'd found an exit. At that point, the female android asks you to wipe both their minds so they can return to the resistance and forget that they ever had hope for something better. The male doesn't want to do it, but she assures him, they'll fall in love again even after the wipe. I won't reveal what happens next, but rest assured, an impact is felt.One of the most endearing aspects of the game are the pacifist robots. A faction of the robot menace has decoupled from the alien intelligence, denounced violence and formed an enclave where they can gather and live peacefully. These beings are the most human creatures in the game, possessing a child like innocence that instantly engenders your sympathy and support. As these robots laugh, cry and express infinite curiosity, 2B, 9S and the other androids struggle with their emotions. It creates an interesting dynamic in the story, suggesting that how human you are is inversely proportional to how human you look and that mankind may have lost its humanity in full long ago.Like the original Nier, the storyline of Nier: Automata is not told in one procedural line, but is divided into blocks. The first takes about 15-20 hours and each one thereafter takes less time. Each block adds important details to the story and the most dramatic elements are unlocked in the last few chapters. All told, you can complete its full story in 55 hours or less, and despite that relatively short length, it was vastly more fulfilling than any RPG I've played in a long time.This game not only restored my confidence in the potential of the genre, its existence is proof that Japanese role playing survives as more than just a shell of its former self and that Square Enix has not yet lost all its good talent.",

    "review_description": "(Note: This is my Steam review of the game. Steam review allows for a limited amount of characters, thus, I didn't have enough space to reflect on certain things like graphics, soundtrack, and performance and more opted to reflect my overall experience of the game. Thankfully, by the time I played it, I didn't have the same performance issues everybody else did and the Soundtrack is phenomenal.)Nier: Automata has something to say. Are you willing to go through a long, game to hear it and still know exactly what it is talking about?This has been #1 on my wishlist for years. It came out at a time I wasn't able to afford full priced games. Nier: Automata had the trappings of a game I would love, a \"cult classic\", Platinum-made, spectacle fighter, with gameplay genre shifts, featuring mechs, androids, spectacle combat, exploration, in a post-apocalyptic world. Nier: Automata sounded like my dream come true, by cleanly mixing genre's I've wanted to see mixed for a very time while pulling inspiration, mechanics, and genres from some of my all time favorite games, . and yet, I wasn't satisfied at the end. Why is that?\"Will I like this game or not?\"What do you value most? Gameplay or Story? Those that value story and philosophy tend to adore this game and claim it to be the best game of all time. Those like me that value Gameplay and appreciate story will have some enjoyable moments, but ultimately be dragged along a long game just to be confused and disappointed. I googled \"i don't get nier automata\" I was surprised to see so many other people who were WANTING to like Nier, but couldn't.Earth is engulfed in a centuries long war between invading alien machines and \"person-like\" androids representing and fighting for the last vestige of humanity taking refuge on the moon.Humanity needs to take back the machine infested planet, and androids are the only ones that can survive it, or at least sacrifice themselves if need be. You're gradually taken through missions of destroying huge machines, running errands for fellow androids, and oddly enough, doing quests for pacifist machines. There is a pretty interesting and complex cast of characters, in the machines that \"disconnected from the network\" and took up studying and mimic human culture and personalities, to the point of some NPCs being inspired by notable real world philosophers. It's just a shame you have to go through alot of gameplay mess to get to the meat of things.What Nier gets right is combat. Like any Platinum game, the mechanics of fighting are solid and mostly satisfyingI say mostly because it does feel great to tear up on enemies, but because it it such a long game, it wears thin after long 60 hour open world errand grind. 2B can equip any weapon into her light or heavy slot, allowing for a wide variety of options, though I found the default weapons more than suitable as the other weapons takes time an effort to make good. Combos are limited, but you can find an infinite attack string with probably any setup, Your Pod can shoot infinite \"Shmup bullets\" or missiles that take time to lock on and do reasonable damage, but I never found other Pod \"guns\".. Pods have many equippable skills like Lasers, explosions, circular blades, and directional spears but have lengthy cool downs. There are other mechanics, like a Counter/Parry attack (which seemed really difficult, charge attacks, and taunting to boost your damage and enemy damage - but these are built into the very imperfect chip system.Chips are interesting at first, requiring you to manage mechanics or features you want to keep or sacrifice in order to to make significant changes to your loadout. At first glance, this is unique and fun, but becomes a hassle and a time sink over-time.You can combine chips of same levels to increase their effectiveness, but this is where things get extremely convoluted. The chip system has developer oversights AND would take hours of grinding to truly optimize. Some chips have diamond versions, taking up less space in your loadout BUT they are very rare AND when you combine them with chips at certain levels, they loose the Diamond rank, requiring you to only fuse them with chips of low capacity OR farming for extra rare Diamond rank chips in order to have the most efficient loadouts. This system is so convoluted that you need a lengthy guide to determine how you should fuse chips to upgrade for the best efficiency, since you can only equip so many chips based on their capacity. Also, expect to spend countless minutes selling, deleting, and fusing chips from your limited inventory. I learned I was basically screwing myself by fusing chips I bought or picked up instead of meticulously managing my chips.This matters because you need all the help you can get, especially on Hard difficulty. Most enemies can kill in one or two hits and fauna out of all things can kill you in one hit. You need increased HP chips or HP restoring chips to survive, but then must make decisions on what abilities or bonuses you want or would sacrifice. Counter mechanics are key in most Platinum games, but because they are hard and risky to execute, as well as took up valuable chip capacity, I didn't use Counter for the entire game. It's neat to customize to your play style, but you may also miss out on certain mechanics in order to increase your damage or conveniently heal yourself, versus using clunky menus to heal during fast paced battles.The overall experience leaves me with mixed feelings.Combat is solid, but is samey after hours of slaying robots.. Boss battles range from incredibly epic to irritating damage sponges, but most are pretty good. Shmup moments are neat for a while, but loses luster after a many uses. Some side quests are good, but there are more than enough \"collect X Number of these things\" Fetch quests or \"kill x number of these things\" quest. There's a \"choose your own adventure\" text adventure segment, but I'm not convinced it was needed. The story has me very confused, as the enemy are mindless machines used to wipe out humanity, but were some how sentient enough to disconnect themselves from the network of their alien masters and decide they want to learn from and emulate humanity.... are they machines or not? And how can they create lifelike, human-like men with skin, blood, all the functions of a human so they can act like androids and also read books of human culture. The story regularly hints how the machines emulate humanity and the main characters think they are just emulating humans from recordings, but they clearly are trying hard to be like humans. It was never clearly stated how a bunch of metal robots designed to kill could still have the intelligence and ability to emulate humans down to their culture and emotions. Then, at the end I'm expected to understand that machines and androids are just like humans. The multiple endings are really more like chapters - the fact that they are considered \"game endings\" falsely made me think these were the end of the game and ultimately, the 26 endings based on the English alphabet are more a gimmick than a good story telling mechanic. Yoko Taro has been both praised and criticized for his strange story telling and players like myself didn't exactly get what the game was \"trying to say\". All this hype, praise and high-minded human existence philosophy and I still have no clue exactly what all I did, why I did it, and how it matters.Rating Nier: Automata is difficult - it is obviously high quality and has something profound to say, but doesn't quite actually say it. There's loads of mechanics, but most of the game boiled down to me mashing attack and dodge or holding the shoot button. Most of the weapons and chip mechanics went unused for me. I spent a long time traveling through an open world slaying machines and running errands and ultimately, I still don't know what the point of everything is. Nier: Automata seems to resonate more with \"Story gamers\" than \"gameplay gamers\" like myself, so be aware of that if you're thinking of buying it, or you may find yourself confused and disappointed.",

    "review_description": " (Played in Japanese on Steam Deck. 36 hours, 59 minutes and 24 seconds to get Ending E on Normal at level 61 with 95% Quest done.)By the time I beat the closest thing NieR Automata has to a “final boss” (Game’s full end credit moving backwards and shooting at me), in April, 2024, I had put 36 seconds short of 37 hours into the game. The first 16 hours were spent with an almost always under-leveled lass known as 2B. Then next 13 hours or so were a mandatory New Game Plus with a fuckboy called 9S. Then last 8 hours can only be called wild.On paper, several similarities can be drawn between NieR Automata and 1986’s Aliens. Both are sequels out 7 years after their respective “first ones” for starter. Aliens’ tagline “This time it’s war” fits Automata kinda sorta. The game’s director YOKO TARO all but admitted the 2017 game was indirectly inspired by Aliens when Halo, famous Aliens clone in interactive form, came up more than one time when he got “dragged” to Seoul to promote Stellar Blade.This is not my first rodeo with Automata. I played up to Ending E back in October, 2017, let the save file back then to be deleted and had planned to play for keeps since. Then 2010s turned into 2020s, 2010’s NieR Replicant got a remake. 3 years after I played and reviewed that one, here I am playing Automata as a sequel. This is how someone with way more cynical and criticizing attitude thinks of this game.The not quite forever war Welcome to the year eleven thousand, nine hundred and forty-five, “11945” for short, Common Era. Earth is fouled up beyond any recognition after a long and devasting war against an alien invasion. But much like the famous year ten millenniums before it, war is about to end here and now. Androids 2B and 9S are on the case to end this eight millenniums long conflict, or so it seems. From how tired both sides are about the war to more than one kind of hidden agendas, this war is not going to end with a clear victor.“NieR: Automata’s story actually is pretty much just a retelling of Evagelion” as YOKO himself said to IGN. Nice of him to admit it since Dr. Austin Walker did point at places in both and said “If you want a happy ending, stop right there.” during his Waypoint days. What neither man said is the patchwork feeling of those stories. Suppose it’s only fair that YOKO did not bring up Yoshiyoki Tomino and the old baldie’s road trip vibe of going somewhere, because Automata’s plot does not seem to go anywhere.Compared to Replicant’s “know a guy to know another guy” flow of journey or quest, the tour of duty in Automata feels disjointed, at least for the first 29 hours or so. 2B and 9S are boots on the ground troopers waiting for orders to go places and kill things. There is just no segways between set-pieces. YOKO could not write a war story to save his own life.The “2B, or [REDACATED]” twist at the end is obvious given the amount of dead deserters in her sub-quests, some are dead before she got to them and some are because she did. And in the “all about a man” way Evagelion is, this game wants you to root for the toxic as fuck lad 9S more than 2B. Just look at how many more times they made him sell his life dearly than 2B.Guess it’s telling sign that the plot as a whole is bit meh, when a trio of ex-Giantbomb staff members only praised the sad tidbits of Automata way back when. In the 8 hours long home stretch, story finally has some resembles of Replicant: a lone killer turned village handy woman and a twat fought through 4 dungeons, but it feels bit too little too late.A loop is a loop is a loopEnough about the story, how does the game play? Well for a simplified action game that take its RPG element more seriously. Among “Aliens clones”, Automata is admirable for making the air-drop section playable, on-rail shooter style. The ground whack fest is the usual spectacle fighter affair, namely left face button for light whack and up for heavy. Right trigger for dodge as Platinum developed games usually do. Right bumper is for shooting both on the ground and in air.As an action role-playing game, Automata takes the leveling aspect of RPG very serious. 10 levels higher means the enemies would die hard while able to one-shot player character. 2B, a favorite for many, usually fights under-leveled throughout her 2 chunks with a 13 hours long break in between.During this break, player has to play as 9S. It’s very funny that the game instantly sinks into Easy Mode. Not only is he at higher level, he can also cheat: up face button with this lad is not heavy whack but ability to hack into the enemy robot in form of a top-down shooter. While this on-a-timer retro style shooter is tense on its own, at least one does not have to worry about being ganged on in the meat space.The hacking mini game works very well with the Chip set for self-healing build. Just avoided the Skill Tree craze since 2018, Automata’s levels are just bigger numbers, but Chip setting is where loot and customization come in. In a way to mimic modern devices, the usual video game interface elements like life bar take up some of the chip space, then one can build something hack focused or fast movement focus. Yours truly chose a build to focus on hit points regeneration, one kicks in over time, one kicks in when I start attacking enemies and final one kicks in when I kill an enemy.While the story feels underwhelming this second time again, Platinum’s gameplay loop proves to be additive. Just one thing feeding into another on the to-do list would keep me up until 2 in the morning. Guess the similarity between Automata and Phantom Pain goes beyond a trailer for their respective third acts: loop is another good one while a sense of emptiness by the end is a bad one.Switched to DeckNieR Automata is unmistakenly a late PS3 game. It runs on Switch with same murkiness and low framerate of Bioshock Infinite on Xbox 360. Well, this is an action game, so the high framerate of Deck helps. Being labeled as just Playable is bit unfair given how smooth this 2017 title can run on the thing and the fonts are easy on the eyes, but I guess pulling up a virtual keyboard just did not cut it back then.Not exactly a model sequelAs a sequel, Automata feels neither bigger nor better than Replicant. The no “bigger” thing might be unfair since my comparison is 2021’s remake, but the more connected feeling of Automata’s locales somehow made the game feel smaller than Replicant’s segments. The beefed up Ver. 1 and all that took me about 50 hours to see most of it stories while Automata took me less than 40 hours. The no “better” thing is that anything Automata can boost about had been done somewhere else, Replicant included. Some old favorite just does not stand a second pass, and Automata just happens to be one with seam showing on a second rodeo.",

    "review_description": "   Most games come with a price tag, and a pretty hefty one at that coming up around $50-60. Recently however there has been a sort of new day for free download-able games witch used to be only for tetris clones. Now with games like D&D online going up for free and this game league of legends being free, well it looks like if you can save that cash for something else.     Now to the actual game. You probably know that it  is  a DOTA style game, and if you watched the quick look then you an get a fairly good idea of what the game is like. Its very competitive and intense. Its hard to play in long stretches but 30-60 min sittings are what this game is made for. Matchmaking works fine and there is a basic leveling system where your \"summoner\" gets access to new spells and what not.     It can be fun to try out new champions but you'll most likely stay with the same 6-7 champions you know best. In this way it seems discouraging to try out new champions because you'll get killed a lot by someone using a champion they know well.     Problems aside the game is a bunch of fun in short doses. If you have a PC then by all means download the game and begin playing. And if you find yourself dissatisfied then you know the worst that happened was that you spent a couple of hours playing a game... and thats never a bad thing. ",

    "review_description": "I´m curently up at 4.30 AM because my adrenaline levels are through the roof. The reason is League of Legends. This game is hands down one of the best I´ve played this year, and thats despite it´s lack of content. This game currently have ONE map to play on and STILL is so fun I´ve probably spent 8 hours playing it tonight. And probably 40 or 50 hours total and I feel like I´m just beginning to get into this game.    LoL follows the Blizzard concept of being very easy to get into and very hard to master. This leads to something you think is really fun in the beginning and so frikkin instense you cant stop playing once you really start to get into the tactics of it. If any of you have played alot of World of Warcraft arena at higher ratings you know exacly what feeling I´m talking about. You concentrate so hard you zone away from the rest of the room and you start to really trying to nail every little second of your playtime. LoL is slowly becoming a real addiction for me. You run into alot of random games where you just get your ass handed to you. But if you get teamed up with 4 team mates that knows what they´re doing while playing a class you really know how to play well and combine that with good teamwork you get a game full of so much gameplay satisfaction its crazy.  And let me tell you right now, this is coming from someone who didnt even try DOTA back when it was a Warcraft 3 mod. I went into this fresh and the sensation of finally starting to get into the flow is, as I said, comparable to Blizzard games like Warcraft 3 or WoW and their fast paced, combo intense, micro heavy gameplay. One game usually takes between 35 to 70 minutes but even after a 70 frikkin minute game you still instantly queue up for another one.   Riot games have nailed supertight controls, a fantastic artstyle and an MMO style account management client where you actually level your account instead of a character. You can spec into different trees and buy runes that enhances your game when your actually playing. So on top of this fast paced, adrenaline pumping gameplay you have this client running in the background tracking your stats and earning you expeirence as you play.   On top of this the game is 100% FREE to play. Just go to their homepage and create an account and youre good to go. If you decide that you like the game enough (wich you will) you can buy skins, heroes and XP boosts for money. Its an excellent business model that hooks you and then makes you feel good about giving them your money.  This holiday season is full of AAA console titles but I find myself playing more of this free PC game from a newly founded studio instead. They were really on to something with DOTA back in the day and with League of Legends this concept gets its own game and an ability to stretch out to the masses and I feel I have to do my part in spreading this message onwards.      The only downside right now is the lack of content. There are loads and loads of characters (or summoners as the game calls them) but the game lacks maps (something I know is on its way) and alot of customization options. The game would really benefit from some announcer voice and UI options. But as I said this cant stop me from feeling more and more addicted to this game for every day.  If you have a super tight game where both teams are masterful at what they do you end up feeling like you had the most gaming fun of the year at the end of the match. You also make alot of friends with whom you can make arranged teams with in the future (via the built in Friends feature of the account client). Oh and speaking of the client. Its a program that lies on your desktop where you can manage your account, your specs, visit the store, join chatrooms, manage your friendslist and more, outside of both a browser and the game. It also acts as a patcher wich is especially handy since this game is in its early stages.  You can approach it from alot of different angles. Are you tired of your MMO and need a break from it? Are you an old DOTA veteran? Are you and old school Warcraft 3 Battle.net player that likes the fast paced micro or are you a causal fantasty fan looking to get into something new and completely fresh? The team at RIOT runs a superb community support, valuing each and every new member. They have started a program to help as many new players as possible to get into this. They are also great at managing the community and making YOU feel appriciated and valued like few before them.    I just felt I needed to write something before I could go to bed. This game is totally addicting for anyone willing to give it a try. Sure there´s alot of jerks like in any online game and they will give you shit when you´re new and cant micro your hero with 300 CPM (clicks per minute) but stick with it, get better and join the game that manages to scratch both the progaming RTS nerve and the progaming MMO nerve at the same time. I´m starting to get into the zone with this game like I did with WoW, WC3 and Quake 3 before it. Total concentration and superfast reflexes.  Its way too easy to dismiss this game as \"something I´ll have fun with for a while but that isn´t really worth my attention right now\". To think like that is making the biggest mistake of 2009 when it comes to gaming. Due to its low profile this game needs word of mouth just like I´m doing here. Try it out and spread the word!  When this game starts to expand its feature set and builds up contentwise there will be nothing stopping it. If you have enough time to dedicate to one game (much like an MMO) you owe it to yourself to start digging into this one.       Oh, and this game combined with a custom iTunes playlist consisting of the World of Warcraft and Wrath of the Lich King OST´s might be the best custom soundtrack fit of all time. I´m not kidding. The tunes of Elwynn forest and Sholazar Basin is a 110% perfect fit for this game.   ",

    "review_description": "Straight off, if you like DOTA you will like this game. Of that i have no doubt, but if you don't like DOTA then this may be a nice way to give it a go. League of Legends (LoL) is a free to play with microtransactions DOTA style multiplayer game. In the game you are what is called a Summoner. The Summoner is basically your ID but your profile also gains XP and levels up giving you access to more spells which can be used in game, more runes and rune slots which are a way of customising your hero/champion in the game. It also gives more Mastery Points which are like skill points from any RPG that can be put into 1 of 3 trees that look very WOW like, but for those who aren't RPG fans all of this is given to you very slowly and methodically such that you learn as you go, but not to slow to be a pain for the hardcore.    You then join a game of which at the moment there is only 1 type and you can either do this alone or in a group which is great if you have friends playing the game as well. You then have to choose what you will take into the game starting with your champion. Your champion is your sole unit in the game, you control nothing else. And there is a great amount of choice, if you buy the game you will start off and be able to unlock a lot more of the champions off the bat, but if you go all free to play then very few will be unlocked. However this if anything is a good thing because it means for your first game you will probably just choose the coolest looking one. You also choose 2 spells which are extra abilities such as a heal, revive or smite that can be used and take no mana from your champion. Then you pick your rune set and you are good to go.    The game plays like DOTA almost exactly. For those who haven't before played DOTA, there are 2 teams each with a main base where the other teams objective is to destroy this. Each side on each lane spawns creeps which can be fought for XP to level up your champion, which when you become strong enough you can try kill the other teams champions and towers so that you and your creeps can advance and take down the enemies base. Also back at your base you can buy items to improve and modify your character. Now LoL does a few things that greatly improve this experience. One is that at the end of each lane on either side is an inhibitor which can be destroyed to send a stronger creep which can secure your victory but it is very difficult to get to and destroy this building. Also at the shop for your champion there are 5 suggested items to buy meaning it is easy to jump in and play as a new champion. You can teleport back to your base at any time. And much more that lead to a great game experience. Another great feature is that if you disconnect you can reconnect to a game, which although seems simple is a great addition because 1 less champion on your side of 5v5 can basically make a team lose.   At the end of the game you earn points and XP. The points can then be used to buy more runes and champions. However skins and champions can also be bought with real cash which is how this game intends to make money. I have yet to pay any money but if i really get into it i could see myself buying a skin for my favourite champion. All in all this game is great and free, so there is no reason not to download it and give it a go. Just go to their site make a free account and get going. ",

The big winners for this Action RTS RPG MMO Game for Personal Computers is the play-times, you can play it for 15 min to 45 min per match. The graphics are great (comparable to Heroes of Newerth) and the gameplay mechanics are NEW; the itemization is great and easy to access via the 1 shop menu. There are many heroes (lots), lot's of purchasable things, and a great PVP.NET system to play with friends.  Things this game lacks: shoddy matchmaking, bloom effects, in-game voice chat, and kind of a ridiculous ratio on free game points (get from winning/playing) and bought items (cash money).  Overall a great game to hop into once in awhile or play with friends. It will also make you angry/happy.",

    "review_description": "I first started playing the game about 7 months ago when it was still in beta. A lot has changed, mostly streamlining the UI and improving performance of the PVP.net client. I can say that the game has blossomed quite nicely, though it isn't quite yet a full flower. There are multiple bugs still around, most notably the chat server disconnect, which forces you to restart the application to start a new game with friends. Things of that nature made me question Riot moving out of beta and into the release phase, but I suppose I can't complain seeing as the game is entirely free. I've been playing with my friends since day one, and am the only one who has yet to spend a single penny, even though I am able to enjoy every aspect of the game that they do (sans Champion Skins, which is purely aesthetic anyway). This might just be me being a cheap bastard, but at least it is no detriment to my enjoyment of the game. Despite the few bugs that still occur, League of Legends is definitely worth trying out, seeing as it is no money out of pocket to just give the game a test drive. Combine that with the colorful graphics and fast-paced gameplay, this game is worth every penny spent (or lack-thereof).",

This is a little odd, as usually the word free draws me in like an ice cream truck to a Weight Watchers convention. In the world of video games, however, I associate F2P with half-assed, graphically challenged boutique games littered with bugs and ads. Due to these prejudices, I approached League of Legends with a bit of trepidation – but its combination of strategic depth and devilishly addicting, competitive team-based gameplay kept me logging in on a nearly daily basis. League of Legends is the spiritual successor to Defense of the Ancients, an enormously successful mod for Warcraft III which has now spawned its own genre.  (If you’d like to know more about DotA, there’s a detailed Wikipedia entry here.)  League of Legends is a 3v3 or 5v5 team-based game that is played on a map with a home base for each team: one in the southwest corner and one in the northeast corner.  There are “lanes” that connect these two bases, and AI-controlled creeps spawn periodically fight their way towards the opposing base.  These lanes are also lined with turrets, which are defensive structures that fire powerful missiles at any enemy that comes within range.  The goal for each team is to invade and destroy the enemy base. League of Legends presently features 49 different champions to choose from, though not every champion is available for use at all times.  The way it works is that there are 10 champions that are free to play, and these 10 free champions are rotated every week.  You can unlock permanent access to champions by spending influence points (earned at the end of every match) or by spending Riot points (bought with real-world cash.)  Champions have different pricing levels associated with them, with the most expensive running 6300 influence points or roughly 7 dollars in Riot points.  There are also quite a few “cheap” champs that you can unlock rather quickly. These champions are split into different categories such as tank, support, mage, and assassin.  You won’t find re-skinned champions with identical skill sets; each champion is unique.  Now balance can be a bit of an issue (from time to time some champions emerge as “overpowered”) but developer Riot Games has been very quick to implement changes to keep the experience as fair as possible.   While champion variety is one of LoL’s strengths, it can also be one of the barriers to access for new players; that long list of champions is daunting at the beginning.  Luckily, LoL has a solid but quick tutorial that introduces you to the game and a single hero.  There is also a practice mode where you can play against other players or AI controlled bots.  Practice games play exactly like the official matches only without the pressure to win.  (I’m a very experienced player with over 250 matches under my belt, but I still play practice matches when I want to try a new champ.)  There is a lively community on the game’s official boards with a plethora of useful information for new players (and the requisite trolling, QQing, and so forth – this is a highly competitive game, after all). So how do the matches actually play?  At the beginning, your champion starts at level 1 with a set allotment of gold and one skill point to spend on skills.  As you kill creeps and enemy champions or structures, you gain experience and gold.  Each level (the level cap is 18) awards you a stat increase and an additional skill point to use as you see fit.  One important element of strategy in LoL is your skill build order.  Some skills are more useful early in the game, while others don’t really play a major part until later in the match.  Whether it’s best to try to max out one skill as soon as possible or to build your skills in a more balanced fashion depends on the type of hero you have selected. The next element of strategy is the item system.  Each home base houses an item shop where you spend your gold on items and/or consumables.  The shop interface is very well-laid out with items categorized by the stats they enhance.  Aside from browsing the shop, LoL also provides recommended items for each champion.  Though these builds are not “ideal,” they often get the job done and make a good starting point for new players.  You’ll also find a huge number of build recommendations in the official forums along with the expected debates over which build is best.   I’m a bit of a number-cruncher at heart, and LoL most certain scratches that itch by way of its deep and complex item system.  Two identical champions can play completely differently based on their item choices.  My main champion at the moment is Sivir, a ranged DPS champion.  Some games I elect to focus on damage and attack speed to attempt to squash the enemy, while other times I can choose to build aura items.  Aura items affect all champions within a certain range, and building Sivir in this way focuses more on making the overall TEAM better, and focuses less on my individual performance. If that’s not enough depth for you, there is the added element of the summoner.  The summoner is a persistent profile associated with your account that levels up as you complete matches.  Your summoner has a three-pronged mastery tree (ala WoW) and the ability to equip runes to enhance your champion’s abilities.  In addition, you select two summoner spells in each match; these are powerful abilities (with long cooldowns) that do things like heal or teleport your champion. The overall look of the game is excellent.  The graphics won’t blow you away by any stretch, but they are clean and help keep track of what’s happening on the often chaotic battlefield.  I’m sure they could have invested in fancier spell effects, but I believe that would be a detriment to the gameplay.  The interface is well-designed with a bevy of tooltips and hotkeys, with all the information you need is well-placed and easily accessible. As mentioned in the intro, League of Legends is completely free to play.  You can elect to spend real-world cash to buy Riot Points, but these points can only be spent on optional skins, IP or EXP gain enhancements, or to unlock permanent access to new champions.  You can’t really “buy power” in the game, and people who elect to spend cash on LoL don’t get any sort of preferential treatment.  Now it would take quite awhile to unlock all the champions without spending any money, though I don’t see the need to have ALL of them unlocked.  Since I’ve enjoyed the game so much, I had no problem investing 20 bucks in the boxed collector’s edition, which unlocked 20 champions gave me a few other extras, like a couple of skins and some Riot points.    There are two significant issues I should point out.  Games are joined based on a matchmaking system which, in theory, matches players in such a way to make the game relatively even. While I find it works fine for the most part, there have been times where one side had an obvious, huge advantage over the other.  In my experience, that is the exception rather than the rule.  The second issue revolves around “leavers.”  Success in LoL is largely dependent on teamwork and good team composition.  If a player disconnects, rage quits, or otherwise exits the game, that particular team finds itself at a huge disadvantage.  While there are presently some penalties for players who leave often, they are not significant.  The majority of the time you find yourself in a match down a player or two, you will lose. Taken together, all of these elements make for an incredibly deep and amazingly competitive gaming experience.  Even six months in with 250+ matches under my belt I still get the itch to log in as much as possible.  If I find myself getting bored with the game, all it takes is a switch over to a new champion to rekindle my desire to play.  Even after all those matches, I don’t see myself ever mastering all the champions, especially since Riot is adding new champs at a steady rate.  Although there are still only two different maps available for play (one map for 5v5 battles and one for 3v3) I don’t see that as a problem.  Because map knowledge and awareness is such a huge factor, it actually helps that the map choices are somewhat limited.  Also, every match plays entirely different as you rarely see the same players or champs on both sides.  And while I’ve had my share of bad matches, the majority of them have been a lot of fun.  If you’re a competitive gamer looking to try something new, I highly recommend giving League of Legends a whirl – it won’t cost you anything to try.  Well, other than the next 6 months of your life, perhaps.",

    "review_description": " If you enjoy RTS's and RPG's, then you would likely fall in love with a game that combines the two genres into a beautiful intermediate. League of Legends, unfortunately, possesses too many flaws to be a recommended title in the genre we mentioned. And these flaws center around one thing.    Matchmaking        Pictured Above: A terrible match    You see, in the FPS genre, players of varying skills can be paired together and still have fun. Take Team Deathmatch for example; This game type pairs a mixture of veterans and noobs into large groups that apply a very loose strategy of \"kill the other person\".  Strategy, you see, is not key here (unless you are a serious gamer in a serious clan) and the number of people on each team is large enough to equally match the other.  League of Legends is in a different genre though. Strategy is important and the number of players is small.  Each match pertains to a goal where five champions must utilize teamwork to destroy the other teams base and claim victory.   It is for this reason that an effective matchmaking system is absolutely vital. But after playing 300+ games, the truth is only about 1 in every 5 matches is ever fair.     Pictured Above: A terrible match    The other 4 matches you will find yourself playing a very one-sided game. Whether you are steamrolling your foes or are the one being steamrolled, its never fun. In these situations inexperienced players ruin things by being improperly matched and often are the times when you will find yourself playing on, or against, a team that is missing a person. (sometimes it can become a 3v5 even!)  Though playing 300+ games appears to counter my point (why play it so much then if its bad?) the truth is I wanted to be fair to League of Legends. I was new to the genre, and so I believed that, overtime, the matchmaking system would come to understand me and begin pairing me appropriately. But sadly this only rarely happened.   The same goes for if you form a premade team. You face the same \"steamroll or be steamrolled\" scenario.       Pictured Above: A perfect match    So in conclusion, I can't really reccommend League of Legends to anyone. While the game is free, the matches arent really fair and thus are only fun 1 out of every 5 games. Given that each match lasts typically for 30 minutes, thats saying you will only receive 30 minutes of amusement during the course of 2 and a half hours of gameplay.  *Hindsight wonders if it was too much for the developers to lower the time for the surrender vote (25 minutes) when 2 of 5 people on your team leave at the start of a match.

    "review_description": "League of Legends is an AoS style game. The point of the game is to work with 3 or 5 teammates and attempt to destroy the opponents base. This is accomplished by choosing a hero and gradually making them more powerful as the game goes on. The only way to win is to outmaneuver the opposing team thus allowing your team to kill the base.  After playing the game for a solid six months I would give this game a 4.5 out of 5. Now when a person starts playing the game, if they have never experienced an AoS style game before they will be lost and confused. Most likely the player will lose the first couple of matches until they memorize how each ability works. The learning curve is steep, but once the basics have been mastered does the game truly start.  The greatest strength  of League of Legends is the strategy behind it. There are almost limitless combos which players can pull off with both their heroes and their teammates. One example of this would be for a person to disable an opponent, this would allow his teammate to easily hit the disabled opponent with a skill shot(an ability which hits the first unit). On top of the strategy for the skill combinations, there is also the many different item builds. Almost every champion in the game is able to play 2+ more roles. the game encourages players to try out new builds and try to discover the best combination. One champion is called Shaco, he is an assassin type character with many builds. The main ones played are AP shaco, which turn him into a ranged hero; Crit damage shaco, which turn him into a melee burst damage type hero; Sunfire Shaco, Gives him extremely high survivability + AoE damage; and finally DPS shaco, which gives him sustained DPS. Each of these different builds give him a different play style to an already complex champion. Even after all this, Riot has added rune pages(small boost to heroes), and Masteries(Think talent points for every hero) for further customization and strategy.  The greatest flaw of League of Legends is the downtime of the servers. While the game itself has very few flaws in it, The servers are usually preventing you from joining. additionally due to the games popularity this problem has just increased in size. A second problem with the servers is that riot is constantly having technical difficulty, in fact one day the servers were down for nine hours while they tried to fix the problem.  In short League of Legends is a great game to play, but be prepared to lose the first few matches. Also be ready for some downtime if the servers become busy or there is a technical difficulty.",

    "review_description": "  Feeling a bit strapped for cash? Looking for a casual friendly title? Into team-based online games? Have a soft spot for a manic-depressive pygmy mummy? This may just be your thing. Nearly two years after its release Riot Games' marquee offering has gone through several layers of polish, numerous balancing updates, and now boasts over 70 different playable champions. Intrigued? Then read on. League of Legends is one of those types of games that seems extremely easy to pick up, and insanely difficult to truly master. The game itself is based on the classic Warcraft 3 map 'Defense of the Ancients', which exploded in popularity shortly after its release. For the uninitiated, the premise is simple: Two teams of 'summoners' (players) control a team of champions (characters) using their unique skills and abilities to assist a never ending wave of troops (cannon fodder) with the ultimate goal of destroying each others' defenses (towers). The maps are split into 'lanes', and typically your team splits up to make sure that all the lanes are defended. The idea is to eliminate the enemy champions thereby allowing your troops, which are uncontrollable and spawn in equal numbers, to assault the towers. By killing enemy troops and champions you get rewarded with gold , which can be used to buy new weapons and items back at your base before you quickly rejoin the fray. The attention to balance is impeccable, right down to the symmetrical nature of the maps. This is one game where winning or losing comes down purely to player skill and team balance, which can be a good or bad thing depending on who you are paired with - I'm looking in your direction, Mr. Foul-Mouthed-I-Wont-Support-The-Team-Ninja from Denmark.  With the basics out of the way, let's carve up this tasty treat see what it has to offer. After downloading the client from Riot's website you are prompted to create an account free of charge and are presented with an appetizing and sleek login screen, followed by a surprisingly amazing cinematic, and then the simple yet effective lobby screen. From here you can view your statistics, join games in a few clicks of your mouse, and peruse the ingame shop to spend your hard earned spoils of battle on shinies such as new characters, runes, and shoes.   Actually, scratch that shoes bit, the Sex and The City fanboy in me is just trying to escape again. Regardless, runes - which you can equip before a match to boost your abilities by a small amount - add another layer of depth to your champions. They are by no means necessary to succeed, but   tinkerers will love to see their efforts well rewarded in battle performance.   It's all suitably RPG-ish and the whole reward system works well overall. After each match you gain a set amount of IP, depending on how well your team did. This is the standard currency, and you can either save them up for new champions, or improve existing ones via the runes. The secondary currency is the Riot Point, which you can obtain by forking over some real world cash. Riot Points allow you to get the said champions without using up your IP points, and to buy boosting items that give you bonus rewards after a match. The fantastic thing is that all the champions are accessible to everyone, you don't have to spend a single dime to collect them all (but you will have to spend a lot more time playing the game to buy them with IP). With the exception of champion skins, which are aesthetic modifications and only purchasable with Riot Points, there are absolutely no hindrances for being a Free-To-Play player. On the topic of skins, some are especially brilliant like the deliciously kinky nurse outfit for the female ninja Akali, or the, ahem, French Maid outfit for jungle babe Nidalee. My perverted musings aside, there is really great value at offer here - and with Riot constantly holding weekly sales and adding new skins on a fortnightly basis there is no shortage of options for customizing your favorite character. The champions themselves are very easy to get attached to, mainly due to the excellent artwork and voice acting accompanying them. Riot have clearly made them the focus of the game, and each and every single one oozes with personality, and their play style is varied enough to keep even the most picky gamer satisfied. Tanks like the armored turtle Rammus soak damage and taunt other champions so that big hitters like lamp-post wielding Jax can do the damage, whilst spellcasters like the lich Karthus fling their deadly payload from the back. Teamfights are intricate, and team balance is crucial, not only to counter the other team but to provide an even mix on your side of things. No champion is 'useless' but there are certainly some more favored than others, and there are definite balance issues when certain matchups lane against one another. To be fair to Riot, with over 70 champions it's going to be nigh impossible to perfectly balance them all and they're doing a stand up job by releasing tweaks and patches at a regular pace in an attempt to polish everything.  Matchmaking is handled decently by a system that recognizes your player progress via an experience bar that shows how many matches you have played and attempts to match you with similarly skilled opposition. Once your player level reaches 30 you become eligible for Ranked matches, which is considered the 'endgame'. If you think that is too low of a cap, note that experience accumulates extremely slowly after level 20, meaning you have to play and win about 20-30 matches to level up, and taking into account that each match averages around 30-40 minutes there is plenty to keep you busy here. Unfortunately servers can be overloaded during peak times, and whilst latency is generally very solid there are regular losses of connection to the pregame lobby chat server, and horrendous 1 hour queues just to login during holidays and weekends. Riot needs to invest in these areas in order to handle the ever-growing player-base if they want to keep things running smoothly. The tutorial is also lackluster in many aspects, and the graphics are extremely dated by today's standards. The upside is that the game is a lot more accessible for older computers but a little bit more sparkle on the presentation would have been nice. Another drawback is the fact that there is an extremely limited selection of maps. In nearly two years since launch there is a grand total of two playable maps, one 5v5 map and 3v3 map.   And whilst the maps are fantastic, a little more variety wouldn't hurt at all. There is an included \"Co-op vs. AI\" mode for when you want to practice with a new champion or implement a new strategy with your buddies against the bots provided. The bots themselves are passable, and on harder difficulty provide a decent enough challenge but they are never going to be a substitute for human skill. Another minor gripe of mine is the limited selection of equippable items during matches. DOTA games are extremely reliant on item builds and specific combos and whilst it's understandable that there is going to be a general preference for Champion A to get Item B followed by Item C a little more creativity would have been nice by offering us more toys to play with. I enjoy seeing unorthodox item compositions and different tricks on champions but unfortunately experimenting is discouraged by the current system.  League of Legends is definitely worth checking out if you're in the hunt for a decent Free-To-Play title. The value and incredible depth contained within are staggering, and it's quite clearly a labor of love for the developers, who continue to add lore and expand the world on a regular basis. If you can handle the downsides that come with a low budget F2P title such as a foulmouthed community, graphical inadequacies and the occasional server outage you will find an intricate and highly addictive game that can be enjoyed on multiple levels. Now if you'll excuse me, my Nurse Akali has to deliver 30-CC's of kickass.",

    "review_description": " League of Legends is a mix of good ideas and bad implementation.  As a  DoTA clone, it starts with a fairly solid core gameplay involving mindless  units charging toward their doom while you pick them off and gain XP and gold  for doing it.  Eventually, your tear down your opponent's defensive  turrets and destroy their nexus, ending the game. What's good about League is the variety of heroes available, and the fact  that it's free to play and you can (eventually) unlock all the heroes using  free Influence Points (IP) earned by playing the game, and each week different  heroes are available without being unlocked so they can be tried out before you  buy them.  This variety in the heroes helps keep away boredom.  The  matchmaking service is also reasonably good, finding suitable matches in  reasonable times and not forcing you to sit endlessly waiting for someone to  join your game, and the primary way they make money is through letting you just  buy heroes (instead of earning them) and through providing strictly cosmetic  skins for the heroes.   I also like that  you can spend several games playing against computer opponents to earn IP and  XP, although you earn much less than you do vs. other players. What's bad?  More than I'm comfortable recommending a game for, some of  it inherent to DoTA clones and some of it unique to this version of the game.   You only get gold for killing minions if you deal them the killing blow,  for one, making much of the game a hunt-and-click on the almost dead minions  while you otherwise stand idly by.  The pace of the game is long stretches  of dreariness punctuated by moments when everything happens all at once -- often  2 seconds of spamming skills determining the direction the next 15 minutes of  the game is going to take.  It's quite possible for a bad teammate to be  worse than a teammate who is afk, since dying feeds the opponents gold and  experience.   I've also seen a lot of  issues with connections to the server, losing about one player every other  game. The most serious offense to my strategy-gamer sensibilities is the  \"account level\".  Within each game, your heroes gain experience  points, but after each game your account earns experience points as well.   This account experience gives you skill points can be spent on bonuses to  your hero, giving them extra armor, damage, etc.  Similarly,  higher level characters have more \"rune slots\" available for similar  buffs to their stats -- did I mention that the runes also become more powerful  at higher levels in addition to having more of them?  This makes me  particularly uncomfortable because level 30 players (the cap) can have a pretty  hefty bonus over those who haven't yet grinded enough to earn those experience  points, for no good game-balance reason.    This isn't a matter of playing \"a few quick games\", but will  require some serious time commitment to achieve level 30.   I've played well over 20 matches (at 45  minutes each), and I'm still only level 10, to give you an idea of how long it  takes to reach level 30 - and yes, the early levels came faster. Overall, this isn't a particularly outstanding game.   With the large number of other solid games  out in the world, I have difficulty recommending this one.   It's free-to-play, so at least I didn't lose  any money on it.   If you want a free DoTA  clone, give this a try -- just don't expect too much.",

    "review_description": "I pre-ordered League of Legends (LoL) before it was released and soon after was invited to participate in the beta for a game type I had never played before. I had never played DOTA (I still haven’t), and only pre-ordered the game because I saw a trailer for it and thought that the game looked cool. I was pleasantly surprised to find a game rich with personality and unlimited potential for expansion which continues to be interesting and updated with new content since its release.Gameplay: Fast, fun, and with new champions being released every so often always changing in new and interesting ways. To quickly explain how this type of game is played, imagine a baseball diamond, where Home and 2 base are connected by a lane. There are 2 teams of 5 players each and they fight over control of the 3 lanes (Home to 2 Base, Home to First to 2 Base, and Home to Third to 2 Base). The two bases that a team can own are either at Home Base or Second Base respectively and the first team to push the enemy team back into their base and destroy it wins. Now when you consider that every hero is different, and offers different benefits and disadvantages to a team and that there are dozens and dozens of heroes to choose from, you have a game that really is always changing and always feels new.Graphics: The graphics are not cutting edge from a technical point of view but from an artistic point of view it is very enjoyable. If you have yet to look at screenshots of the game imagine World of Warcraft or a “cartoony” looking game with bright colorful characters. In a day and age when a lot of games are released with realistic looking browns and greys, it is refreshing to play a game that looks bright and colorful, without coming off as childish. If you are one of the few people out there that are put off by these types of graphics don’t let that stop you from trying out this game, because in the heat of battle you really don’t notice that everything is bright and colorful, it is all about the hectic and exciting gameplay at that point, trust me.Story: No story to speak of. It does not hurt the game but is should be noted. This is a multiplayer game through and through which means there are no cut-scenes there is no explanation for this world to exist. There are small paragraph sized backstories for each hero, but that’s about as complex of a narrative as you get with this game. All you need to know is as the player, there is a blue team and a purple team, you have a base you must protect, and they have theirs and you must do everything in your power to beat them, that’s it.Sound: Sharp and well done. It is a multiplayer game, so you’ll hear characters screaming things as they cast spells or as they die, and there is an announcer which will let you as the player know that an enemy has died or someone on your team has fallen prey to them. Again much like the story aspect of the game there is no orchestral sequence or great soundtrack, it’s not that complex, it’s a multiplayer game were heroes cast magic at each other.Overall: I will not deny my experience with this game. I have played over 700 hours of it (I am not joking) and after those 700+ hours I must say the game is as fresh and exciting as it has ever been. They release new heroes on a regular basis and every time a new hero is released new strategies of how to play the game are created. It really is amazing how they have released dozens of new heroes since launch and yet the game still remains balanced and fair, for both paying people and completely free playing members alike. It may take free players a bit longer to get every hero but by allowing them to get it eventually by playing the game, it really is fair to everyone, which explains the game’s boom in popularity.I see no reason why anyone should rob their chance at playing such a fine example of free to play gaming other than not being interested in this type of game. It’s completely free, it auto updates (as if it were on Steam) and it keeps getting better as time goes on.

    "review_description": "People who play League of Legends are an angry bunch, by now you must of heard. Being one of the worst online communities in history is at this point both an understatement and undeniable fact, compelling even Riot Games to take action against its players' uncontainable ego. They've actually added features designed solely to discourage the incessant negativity, recently awarding virtual ribbons to 'friendly' gamers (heads up -- they aren't). Maybe the game isn't fun, you wonder, but then judging a game by its players doesn't seem in good taste. Instead, you could try it out yourself -- it's free, after all -- and see where the hatred comes from. Because it's the game, dammit, and soon you'll be a monster, too. Oddly enough, a new account will greet you with comrades who are friendly, helpful, and more curious about the game and its colorful roster of champions than they are about properly dominating the fields of justice. The free to play model shines brightest in these early stages, arousing player interest in a number of ways. To start, you can now choose from over 100 unique champions, where every week a different set of 10 is made freely available. As you explore their different play styles you can then purchase favorites with actual money, or by using points (IP) earned by simply finishing matches. Choosing the free route, one can quite enjoyably cruise to the max level of 30 without ever spending money, earning enough IP to collect a number of personalities all while testing out the free picks each week.  It's during this process of exploration where LoL is most innocent and perhaps -- before your heart turns to cold steel -- even the most enjoyable. Truly, could a game look any less intimidating? A battlefield reminiscent of 100 Acre Woods populated by collectible characters -- many of whom wouldn't be all that out of place alongside Winnie the Pooh himself -- LoL is undeniably adorable and yet somehow molded around fierce competition. Three lanes lead from one end of the map to the other, continuously spawning waves of minions to march down them.The objective is to help your own little dudes push down the turrets that line the road to the enemy's base, and finally destroy the Nexus within. Where opposing waves meet is where the essence of League of Legends lies, because its the minions that yield not only the experience points that level your character, but also the gold that buys you powerful equipment back at base. Gold isn't shared, it merely goes to the killer, and so with only 3 lanes of minions and 10 champions playing the field, LoL demands that team members prioritize themselves into specific roles so as to farm the most possible gold from the minion waves. When all is said and done, what you generally get is 4 champions sorting the lanes into individual 1v1, 1v2, or 2v2 match ups against the other team. Meanwhile, the 5th player often plays behind the scenes, killing neutral monsters in the game's jungles while staying hidden by the fog of war. He levels at his own pace while looking for opportunities to help his team in the lanes, popping in for occasional ambushes. Really just an RTS styled computer game with singular unit control, avoiding death in LoL is as simple as spacing yourself properly from perceived dangers. In turn, killing is as simple as catching other champions out of position. It's not technically difficult to understand or mechanically hard to perform, just a bunch of right clicking to move around, dodging spells, and staying out of harms way. But it's this kind of simplicity and common sense that make LoL both infuriating and addictive. Catching an opponent off guard is rewarding in how it makes them look like a complete fool, and you a total mastermind. There is no in between, no graceful way to accept a death, or humble approach to take a life. Someone screws up, and another takes advantage of his stupidity. Consider how humiliating LoL can be. Maybe you're Gangplank, the pirate with a sword but also a flintlock pistol that can be fired every few seconds or so. The match begins and you head off to your assigned lane as the first waves of minions make their way towards each other, clash, and create a point of contest where you will meet the opposing champ. Maybe it's the little girl, Annie, who wears a pink dress and dangles a teddy bear at her side. Well aware of her deceiving looks, you dance around carefully, managing your mana, harassing the little girl with shots from your pistol, and whacking minions for gold. A couple minutes pass and your confidence is brimming. You've gotten Annie down to half health, scaring her away from the minion groups and thus starving her of any profit. But then she does something strange, and your brain knows it's strange but your ego won't accept the warning signals. She comes after you, within killing distance, and presents her life to you. And the moment you commit to taking it is when her friend from another lane leaps out of some bush, stuns you, and melts your hp. These moments can destroy a man's soul. For one, dying means you have to sit in limbo for half a minute and watch helplessly as this little girl takes free reign over your lane, knocks down your turret, and farms as many minions as she pleases. It could also give the enemy team a crucial power play, allowing them to safely slay the map's dragon -- a mini objective -- for even more gold. And you can't hide your utter failure from your teammates, not when a very egregious game announcer laments: \"An ally has been slain!\" over everyone's headset. You can't hide the fact that a powerful Annie is now roaming across the map, terrorizing other lanes, and dismantling your team. Here is a game where you what your teammates do is largely out of your control (you have your own lane to worry about) but whose mistakes you'll have to make up for later on when the team finally groups together.  But on the flip side (the victor's side), these moments breed glory and character love, which is LoL's continual selling point. Performing well with a champion renders it a symbol of pride, hence why so many people shell out cash for collectible skins to dress them with. And though each character ultimately wields similar tool sets of stuns, slows, and things like attack speed and lifesteal modifiers, Riot still manages get the hype rolling for new ones, even when they don't necessarily add any new dynamics to the field of play. There's a champion in here for everyone, all voiced with enthusiastic talent, all containing their own charms, easy to grasp controls, and colorful spell effects. Shape shift into a dragon, combo into brutal finishers, or meld into the shadows. Even when it's all the same -- that is, getting the jump on the enemy -- the fun is all in the details. But the conformity of the champion designs also merit a good deal of criticism, since there are so few that can make the game's occasionally long match times (45+ mins) interesting. Iconic champions like Ashe, the frost archer, can fire a giant ice arrow clear across the map, while the killer robot, Blitzcrank, can shoot his arm outwards and yank an unsuspecting enemy into the clutches of his team. Such champions force exciting plays to happen, whereas many others fall into the defensive meta game that LoL is ultimately settling for. The community blames each other for this, as they blame each other for everything, but in reality, long and passive games are a result of fundamental design more than anything. It's a game about capitalizing on mistakes, and as you play with smarter players, less mistakes are made, and a great deal of mulling about, gold farming, and hesitant acts of aggression can create mundane time sinks from time to time. But plays happen, and they always will. Even at the professional level someone is going to do something horrifically unintelligent and in turn get punished for it, and depending on what end of the abuse you find yourself on, it'll render you as either a raging gremlin or leering jester, succumbing you to nervous breakdowns or basking you in imaginary applause. And whether the match spirals to hell or not really doesn't matter, since it's so easy to be convinced that the next match will hold better luck. That maybe next time you'll be able to pop some enemy champions, bathe in their bounties, and pull a team of dysfunctional clowns through to victory. It's a team oriented but individually driven game, and you must remind yourself that everyone playing it is clueless, that you are their savior, and that if you aren't playing League of Legends angry, then you probably aren't playing it correctly.",

    "review_deck": "best hardcore ranked PvP game, hands down",
    "review_description": "League of Legends (5v5 Summoner's Rift) is hands down the best hardcore ranked PvP game out there.By hardcore, I mean, if you are going to play at least 15-30 hours a week while you are active. If you are going to play 2 hours a week, Ranked Summoner's Rift may just frustrate you (and others). If you want to casually play a few hours here and there, I recommend playing ARAM, or unranked (normal) games of 3v3 Twisted Treeline or 5v5 Summoner's Rift.By best, I mean that it has the highest skill ceiling, the lowest amount of cheating **, the most playstyle variety the most competitive ladder, largest player base, and it's been doing it for over 10 years now.The MOBA / DOTA game design is amazing in itself, because of the way players are always under PvP pressure, but not necessarily to always kill their opponent. Laning against an opponent, trying to earn gold, while under the pressure of a human player, is an amazing and fun dance of skill and wits. At higher levels of play, where everyone knows what champions are capble of what and who \"wins\" in any given situation, it truly becomes about mind-games. It's amazing...and yet the champions themselves are relatively simple. Most champions have just 4 skills and a passive. So it doesn't take a long time to get the basic gist of a new one. So when someone trounces you with a champion, there is no reason to get frustrated. Just learn that champion too, so you can do the same... and so you can learn it's weaknesses. Because every champion has weaknesses.Which brings me to balance. League of Legends is incredibly well balanced, but I wouldn't say it's \"evenly\" balanced. It's a type of constantly moving rock-paper-scissors balance. The game and game balance constantly changes, every champion has strengths and weaknesses, and each one can be fielded by only one player. If you think a champion is too strong at the moment, you either need to ban it, or you need to play it! ------The complaints people lodge against League all stem from the same source -- the feeling that one \"can't climb because of teammates\". This is a myth. While teammates certainly affect game outcomes... everyone has the same matchmaker RNG, and yet some people climb and some people don't. 30% of your games well be \"free\" wins, 30% of your games will be unrecoverable losses, the question is, what do you do with the other 40%?First off, one of the reason teammate kill is all over the map, is new players ranked too high. Typically, when a new casual player jumps into ranked league too fast, they get a provisional rank in silver or gold, because it's not that hard to get placed there initially. Then they proceed to cause losses in 60-70% of their games until they get demoted to bronze or iron, all the while flaming their teammates for being terrible, thinking they belonged back up in Gold. When in fact, they did not. If you play ranked alot, and you look up player match histories, you will see this pattern alot. I know I do. Moreso, most new players start out as \"that guy\", thinking they are better than they are. I know I did. It's essential to realize, the only person you can control in a game is yourself, so blaming the matchmaker, or the other players, or afk, or whatever -- is just a way to avoid looking deep and accepting that \"your just not that good at the game (yet)\".When you get good, you can climb. If you get stuck, don't waste energy blaming people, get better. Rethink. Change your strategy. Learn more champions. Play more normals and try random stuff out. And for the love of League, please learn to consistently get at least 10cs per min. If you can't, you have no right to say anything. Your low gold is the reason you are losing.Most importantly, don't play a game you are not in. Look at the game you are in realistically. As yourself \"what can I do right now to increase my chance of winning this game?\" Play to your strengths not your weaknesses. Look at the scoreboard and don't try to duel the fed enemy Akali. And if you have died twice early, maybe pull back a little, concede some farm, but keep yourself in lane for XP and for the farm you can get.The complaints people lodge against League include, chat toxcity, bad/afk/troll players, elo hell (aka, that you get stuck in low ELO, because \"other\" players are bad in low elo, not because of you).Chat toxicity is real. People get downright angry at other players when they do things that seem bad for the team. Even when people are trying to say helpful things, it often comes off critical when a player feels bad about a mistake they made. Fortunately, you can now turn off both all and allied chat, and have a completely toxcitity free experience. There is a robust ping and emote system, which is sufficient for 90% of what you need, at least at low ELO. If you want to leave chat on, the best strategy is to just not say anything about plays in the past, afterall, unless you have a time machine, chatting isn't going to fix them. If you want to give a suggestion, make it gentle, and about the future. \"We should try to get the next dragon.\"Players do AFK from time to time... which is unfortunate, because when one player AFKs in a 5v5 game, it affects 4 other players negatively. You can win games where people AFK, so try your best. Make this one of the 40% of games you can affect. But don't get too bent. Over time, you will see as many AFK players on the enemy team as on your team. Just make sure you tryhard to win the games with enemy AFKs - because you can lose those if you are not careful.** There are some bot fun (PUBG/APEX) And compettive (CS:GO) FPS games out there, but the public ladders are filled with cheaters, aimbots, ESP etc.  ",

    "review_description": "I'll start this off by saying that Cyberpunk 2077 is not the game it needs to be, or the one it tries to be, at this point in time. It may get there eventually but what we've got at release time is an incomplete, bug-riddled, mostly lifeless form of what most of us were envisioning. The opening video sequence seems to paint that vision well, with a dystopian city that's oozing with action, crime, sex, drugs and violence. However, once you get settled in and the initial awe of the cityscape fades, you're left with world that's mostly devoid of personality and can't figure out what it actually wants to be. Also, yea, there's quite a few bugs that will be impossible to not notice…I could almost excuse the visual and game play bugs if the title was more fun to play but unfortunately that's not the case. The combat is clunky and repetitive, the driving and navigating city traffic is mostly annoying, and the items/progression system is just there to be there. Friendly AI is constantly getting in your way (might be my biggest peeve in any fps) and there's health drops almost everywhere you look. Some of the weapons are fun to look at, and I like the customization--but it's not enough to keep me interested personally.Night City (terrible generic name btw) is genuinely breathtaking upon arrival, and admittedly you could just spend your first hour or two snapping screenshots, however that chaotic \"always alive\" vibe that you're introduced to falls away pretty quickly. Despite the loads of NPC's walking about and some little pockets of criminal activity, there's nothing there. The police don't chase you (they can't even drive cars to do so) and the whole crime vs punishment system doesn't actually exist; there's essentially no negative repercussion for doing bad things.Luckily, Cyberpunk does offer some commendable characteristics. For one, it is a very pretty game IF you can afford to pay the steep eye-candy bill. There's no denying that it can't look good for the few who've got the beefcake hardware to both keep the frames up and the glam active. Secondly, the story does offer writing that's competent enough to grab you and it does so with quite a bit of style. Some of it's a little over the top of course, but that's what we kind of signed up for after all. Most of the main characters are very stylized, animated and voiced well, and relatable for the most part. CDPR still has a bit of work to do, but I think they will stay true to their word and get the game more polished up in the coming months. It's going to take some time though, and it may be difficult to ask many gamers to be patient. It’s really hard to recommend the game in its current state and at full price nonetheless but you might find something to like under all the mess. The release of this game has me somewhat worried about the future of AAA gaming and other large-scale projects that might be carried out by other self-published developers. There are lessons to be learned here but I also can’t help but applaud the talented developers at CD Projekt Red for taking on such a risky and ambitious project.That’s all for now, gonks.",

    "review_description": " The question that will never get answered, although we can guess, is how this game turned into such a shit show?The setup...You play as V. He's a mercenary and does odd jobs for money. You can go kill people or deliver special items. The problem V runs into is that a heist he was in on went bad. To make things worse he put a bad chip in his head. What makes it bad is that it is corrupt and ends up putting the consciousness  of another person into his. Enter Johny Silverhand, aka Keanu Reeves. Johnny is now talking to V and essentially manipulating him. Together they try to find a way for them both to survive and to achieve their goals against the corporations.What I liked...Almost nothing. I liked one character, Judy. That's literally about it. Nothing else even comes to mind.What I didn't like...I don't even know where to start here. So... characters. Outside of Judy they were all bad. Johnny just seemed like a manipulative shit bag that whined and moaned about how bad the corporations were but could never really explain why. V was just a meandering bag of nothing interesting. Everybody else just didn't stand out in any way to a point that I can't even remember any other names to even talk about them.Onto to the story. It wandered all over the place and didn't come together in the end. Maybe I missed something or just wasn't paying enough attention but there were times when characters said or did something that just didn't fit in. At the end of the game I found myself scratching my head asking myself \"how the hell did we get here?\".Want to talk about skills? Don't bother using them in this game. There is a very elaborate skill tree that is rendered almost completely useless. There is a way around any situation they present you without using any of your skills. Which in theory sounds like good game design. However, when you do use a skill it seemingly has little to no effect. The only skill I found useful was hacking a turret to turn it off. The most infuriating one was hacking/picking a door. I would walk up to one and it would say my skill level was too low. My skill level is three but the door needs four. So I dump points into the skill. Next door I walk up to, my skill is too low. My skill level is a four but the door needs a five. So I dump more points into it. Walk up to the next door, my still is too low. The door needs a skill level of six, mine is only five. Forget this skill. I never opened one of these doors the entire game.All the other stuff...So, I tried to look beyond the technical issues but I have to admit they did affect my experience with the game, obviously. I played on a launch series Xbox One which was probably the worst platform to play it on. The environment looked wash out and fuzzy all the time. With the aesthetics they were going for and all of the artwork they did, it should have popped on the screen. You want 60 fps? Not on this console, if you got 20 it was a good day. There wasn't a moment I played that game that it wasn't dropping frames. It got really bad during some of the boss fights which is probably the worst time for it to do so. Driving cars was terrible. The driving seems to drift somehow on its own and it never felt like I was really in control. Imagine driving on an oil slick. Even the camera angle for the first-person perspective felt wrong but when I moved it the game would just recenter it to where it originally was. I ended up driving in third-person but it was still bad. I'm going to stop complaining.At the end of it all... Even looking beyond the jank, this is just a mediocre game. I suffered through Mass Effect: Andromeda and would rather go back to it than this game. Cyberpunk 2077 tried to do so much but missed the mark almost every single time. I didn't do much of the non-story stuff because it didn't feel like it added anything to the game. When it's all said and done, I think that if CD Project Red had put less into the game and crafted what was in the smaller game I think they may have made a better game.I didn't even want to write this review but I'm hoping that if I get the words out to the Internet they'll leave my head and I can stop thinking about this game.",

    "review_deck": "Finding the joy in quiet moments",
    "review_description": "I tried to play Cyberpunk 2077 on my PS5 about a year ago. At that point the game had been out for a little over a year, and many of the bugs / issues people had complained about had been fixed. I decided to finally check it out, and see the game underneath all the controversy. I made it about 5 hours in. It was loud, obnoxious, punchy, and frustrating. Everything about it felt extreme and grotesque to me. The hyper-sexual ads around the city, V and Jackie’s talk about becoming “legendary” “no matter what” just wasn’t striking a chord with me. To make matters worse, every time my roommate walked by she complained about the visuals, or the dialogue, saying she “hated watching me play this game.” I felt like I was wasting my time, and like this one just wasn’t for me.Fast forward to the end of 2022, maybe 8 months after selling CP77 on eBay after deciding I didn’t want to keep going with it. I started a new job, and was becoming friends with one of my new coworkers. She told me Cyberpunk was a favorite of hers. She said she loved the quiet moments around Night City. This sentiment really struck me, because in my short time with the game, I hadn’t had ANY quiet moments. What had I been missing? I pondered whether or not to rebuy the game for a while. I really wanted to get closer with this coworker. While we had a lot of common interests, we hadn’t played many of the same games. I figured checking out CP77 would give us more to talk about. Plus, I had just gotten a Steam Deck for Christmas, so this could be one of the first games I played on there.I decided to restart Cyberpunk sometime in January of 2023. I felt invigorated by the idea of having more to discuss with my new friend, and hurried through the initial 5 hours I had already played. I had stopped playing the game RIGHT before V’s “death” and meeting Johnny. I had no idea THIS was the full plot of Cyberpunk 2077! Two consciousnesses stuck in one body, fighting for control. One a terrorist from 50 years ago. The other a reckless young adult looking to make a name for themself. At first, I hated Johnny’s guts. I’ve never been a big Keanu Reeves person. Him IMMEDIATELY trying to kill V had me feeling unfavorably about him.Regardless of how I was feeling, the world was finally opening up to me, and I had my goal. To find Night City’s quiet moments. I started off doing the main story for a bit, but once I had established the Voodoo Boys and the Takemura quest lines respectively, it was time to dive deep into side quests. I was shocked by the amount of side quests CP77 had to offer me. At first, I was mostly interested in figuring who the love interests were. I kept getting more and more calls with things to do and places to check out. People to meet. Each new quest was a mystery, fresh and exciting.After doing most of the side quests in Cyberpunk, I can say with certainty this game presents side content in the best way I’ve ever seen it. I felt like every time I finished a side quest, I got a call about another. Their progression felt natural, and their content was fantastic. I loved how relevant each side quest was to V’s own situation. They all contextualized V’s circumstances in a new way, begging the player to question what was happening to them and how to feel about it. The Peralez quest line being about the overwriting of a person’s memories. It made me wonder, without your memories, are you still you at all? Can you trust yourself anymore? It made me imagine V thinking about that, watching their own memories slip away. Or Lizzy Wizzy. She had changed so much after fame and implants, her boyfriend was afraid of her. He was worried about what she might do. She had chosen these changes, brought them upon herself, and had to live with the consequences. He was right, she ended up murdering him and being delighted by the outcome. It must’ve been strange for V, watching someone destroy themselves intentionally, when they never had a choice.I’ll be honest, I didn’t love any of the romantic options. I played female V, so I could either pursue River or Judy. I saw both of their storylines through, romancing each of them. River’s was okay. I thought the stuff about his nephew was deeply sad and powerful, and enjoyed the mystery leading up to it. His romance with V felt tame to me though. I liked the idea of V joining his family and having a place to go back to, but it kind of felt like settling. Judy’s romance was weird for different reasons. It felt like Judy and Evelyn had a very intimate relationship, and like we were helping her get through that. It was SO tumultuous taking down Clouds, and after all that to just…get together? Like everything is okay? Felt off to me. Judy felt like a good friend, and someone I wanted to support, but not someone to pursue. I didn’t mind not being able to romance Panam or Kerry though. Panam was a mess who only cared about herself and her chaos family. I didn’t enjoy any of my quests with her. I like Johnny’s history with Kerry, but his hatred of a kpop girl group was ? concerning to say the least.Ultimately, Johnny was the character I adored and always wanted more of. V and Johnny’s banter felt like the “quiet moment” idea I was searching for. The two of them felt at home together. The storyline of Johnny and his band mates was ABSOLUTELY the best one in the game. It showed V and Johnny’s mutual trust and respect for one another, and tested their relationship. The scene with Johnny and V in the landfill where Johnny’s body was buried broke my heart. I had V tell him that he was “the guy who save their life,” and hearing Johnny say that all he wants is for that to be true was so touching. Johnny is his best self with V. This is the only time he’s put another person before himself. It feels like he’s finally who he’s always wanted to be. I genuinely love Johnny and V’s relationship. If I could choose how the game ended, it would be V and Johnny getting to inhabit this body together until the end of their days. Playing female V added a lot to this dynamic too. Johnny was a complete ass to Alt and Rogue, and it feels like V taught Johnny that women are actual people.Another quiet moment I loved was riding around the city on Jackie’s bike. Turning on some jazz and cruising across this wild, loud, vivid city was relaxing and striking at the same time. It gave me time to reflect on whatever quest I was in the middle of, or to get a call about a new one, or to stumble upon a random interesting thing. It brought harmony to the experience. Being able to call Jackie a few times and catch him up on everything that was going on was so sweet. V’s last goodbye to him was a lovely touch. When all the voicemails played during the credits, it made me think of us calling him after his passing.Overall, my time with Cyberpunk was a delight. It made me think, it made me cry. It gave me a place to explore and discover. The characters I met and the way I felt while playing this game will stick with me. I’m grateful to my friend for motivating me to give it a second chance, it was certainly worth my time.",

    "review_description": "Based on a board game franchise Cyberpunk created by Mike Pondsmith, Cyberpunk 2077 had awesome intent, but it was a complete mess all of a sudden. During the later part of its eight-year development cycle, the game has generated overwhelming hype among the gaming community, with CD Projekt releasing several promotional content and promised it to be \"the next-gen open world experience\". However, after a series of incidents and CD Projekt's internal problem, the game's release ended up to be one of the most disastrous launches since the release of Fallout 76.So the plot is this: the player character, known simply as \"V\", is offered a contract from a big-time fixer called Dexter DeShawn to steal a device from the Arasaka Corporation known as the \"chip of immortality\" along with his/her mercenary friend Jackie Welles. This plan goes disastrously as Welles is killed and the chip gets damaged, forcing V to insert the chip into his/her head to prevent its destruction. Angered about all the attention he is going to receive from the police and Arasaka, DeShawn shoots V in the head and leaves them for dead, with DeShawn getting killed shortly afterwards. V awakens in a landfill, where he/she is haunted by the digital ghost of Johnny Silverhand, a very famous war veteran and rock star. Through Silverhand's memories, V discovers that an AI called \"Soulkiller\", which can be used to prevent Silverhand from taking over V's body. V then sets out to plan about how to access Soulkiller to remove Silverhand from his/her brain before Silverhand completely takes over.Most of the issues, which involved bugs and problems with AI that made it behave braindead, were fixed as of 2022. I will first cover the pre-2022 version.The game was announced back in 2011-2012, however, due to shift of the workforce to The Witcher 3, the development had been halted until the aforementioned game was released in 2015. After 4 years of hiatus, CD Projekt Red finally started their work on the game in 2016. The game was rushed, however, in order to meet their 2020 deadline resulting in a broken and (at times) unplayable mess. This was all because the heads of CD Projekt were so confident that they could complete it because they made The Witcher 3 even though the developers constantly told them that it wouldn't be ready. After the game went gold, they delayed the game by two more months; while this isn't the first time this happened to a game, it's never a good sign. During the first few hours of the game's release, CD Projekt released a 58 GB of hotfix patches for the game, with the patch itself being as large as the base game's file size.Because of a combination of rushed development and various publicity stunts, CD Projekt made many promises when Cyberpunk was announced, but two things happened to all those promises: either they were in the game but were very poorly implemented or executed or they were just lies. In the early months of the game, CDPR said they would fix the performance and game code issues. While a majority of them were fixed, the damage was already done. What's worse, during their massive promotional campaign between 2019 - 2020, CDPR tried to promote the game to be as \"immersive\" as possible by advertising even the tiniest and ridiculous of details. The most infamous example being when they tried to promote the penis customization (yes, really, sorry I had to mention that) feature to generate internet clout about the game.An absolutely horrendous number of bugs and glitches (plenty of which game-breaking) are possibly even worse than FIFA. Now with the numerous patches these problems don’t happen usually but they were an absolute plague when the game first launched. The textures suffer long loading times; oftentimes certain textures will disappear when the camera is at a certain angle and suddenly re-appear when the camera is no longer at that specific angle. The NPCs disappear when you move the camera away from them. Falling out of the world is common thanks to glitchy collision. Vehicles explode for no reason when started up. V dies by simply running into something. Your character does T-poses, loses clothes/body parts, and starts to flicker while driving on a vehicle. Animations may not load, such as the character's mouths not moving when talking outside of cutscenes. The NPCs can also get stuck in T-poses and fly for no reason due to poor physics and collision, which can lead to cars being sent flying out of nowhere. The poor physics also cause objects to get flung into the air at high speeds, as well as the game sometimes acting as if the player drove into a wall when they hit an NPC. V's death (depending on your choices) is otherwise pretty emotional.Even worse are unobtainable items. Prior to patch 1.5, if something is even slightly compenetrated inside a box, a table or a ramp of stairs it cannot be collected. The iconic Nue handgun “Death and Taxes” is the most notable example as before patch 1.3 there was no way to get it outside of spawning it through console commands. Also, sometimes the enemies will automatically detect your presence from afar and start shooting even if you just arrived and didn’t do anything yet (also corrected in patch 1.5).The A.I. is laughably idiotic, especially the police that don’t react to gang members attacking you and appear out of nowhere every time you commit a crime. Sometimes the police spawn in the wall making it impossible to kill them (to make matters worse, they can still shoot you). On the other hand, ordinary NPCs behave as if they were blind and live in an alternate reality as you can see how they touch (and occasionally clip through) each other while walking or even enter the object through an unnatural way, like entering the stairs from the vertical side (in the sense that they won't go up the stairs from the normal path, but climb to a little wall with their legs, like they do in parkours, without jumping). The player can also sometimes clip right through them as if they weren't even there. When getting shot at, at times NPCs tend to pretend like nothing's happening as they rarely ever take cover and walk around casually. Due to the lack of driving A.I., police car chases are mostly non-existent outside of missions.The driving A.I. is completely absent from the game. Every NPC car always drives in a fixed path as programmed meaning they offer little to no interaction with the player since they will never attempt to dodge any explosion, escape from firefights or behave dynamically with the traffic situation. You can easily park a car in the middle of the road and the NPC's will never try to evade it. Since all cars move in their fixed path, thanks to an unpolished driving path, the A.I. driver will attempt to drive and clip through obstacles and walls, which can result in their car exploding due to collision. Also, when fighting vehicles in close quarters, the destroyed vehicle will oftentimes block the player's way, preventing them from progressing further and forcing them to restart the mission.A lot of content was cut due to the game being rushed:One notorious example is the life paths the player chooses at the beginning of the game all playing out exactly the same once the players are done going through the intros (which are vastly different from each other). The only remnant of these life path exclusive plot elements are missions where V steals back their old car (Nomad)/does one last job for Kirk (Street Kid)/confronts their old friend (Corpo). Speaking of which, a few plot elements exclusive to the intro of the Corpo path are ditched entirely in favor of going down the same plot as the other two life paths.Abilities such as running on walls weren't included in the final cut.The robot teammate T-Bug was supposed to be a companion throughout the entirety of the game but gets killed near the end of the first chapter.The player would have been able to unlock multiple apartments for V instead of just one. While the game does include unlockable apartments, these apartments aren't V's, meaning that the number of features in those apartments are very limited. This feature was eventually added in patch 1.5.Third-person cutscenes were scrapped as well, which would have been one of the few ways to see what V looks like.As shown in the trailers, players were supposed to be able to ride on trains and use the train stations.Because of the game being mostly in first-person view, character customization feels somewhat pointless as there is rarely any opportunity to see what your character looks like outside of opening up your inventory. A few customization options commonly present in other games are absent here, such as adjusting V's height.As mentioned earlier, many of the features seen in the trailers and mentioned in articles (such as dynamic NPCs, buyable apartments, an impacting Day/Night cycle, bar and food places that are open and interactive, and most famously, a wanted system and corrupt police that you can bribe) are completely absent in the actual game.Many of the standard features in the game are downgraded, such as cars being invincible to weapons, water effects being absent, and NPCs not reacting to being rammed by your car. Even many open world games decades ago of the 3D universe games have way more functional features than this game.CD Projekt said that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions work well when they have plenty of hiccups and them being first released in an abhorred state. What's even worse is that they knew about this and made critics review the PC version instead of the console versions and provided footage themselves instead of letting critics show their own gameplay.As mentioned above, the physics are terrible for today's standards as they are incredibly buggy, the vehicles controls are rigid and sluggish and everything feels very light and floaty. The ragdoll physics are especially terrible and stiff feeling which becomes extremely noticeable when an NPC is ran over with a car. Adding to the terrible controls, the vehicles have weird collisions with the vans being the absolute worst due to both slow speeds and a gigantic hitbox that will often block your bullet. The motorcycles are just as bad, but are at least more versatile than the cars.There are no playable minigames unlike The Witcher games which are known for their great minigames (one of which, Gwent, got its own game). The closest thing players have is seeing gameplay of arcade games in their respective arcade cabinet. Eventually, a mini game, Roach Race, was added on patch 1.6, but that's still only one.While there are dialogue options in the game and the players can decide whether to spare or kill enemies, these choices barely make any difference to the story at all, and you also have to press X/triangle/E for things that should happen automatically like taking a shard or exiting a vehicle.The game is infamously known for its terrible optimization. The worst offenders are the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 versions, as most of the times their respective framerates can at times dip below 20 fps, making the game almost unplayable; though to be fair the patch 1.3 fixed the issue for the most part on the last generation consoles. The PC version has less framerate issues, but the problem is that the game requires a very high-end PC just to run the game, something that contrasts with the official requirements that state that a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card is able to run the game at high quality, and even if you have a high-end PC there is a probability that the game will run incredibly bad or have stuttering issues, mostly when you're driving or walking through a highly populated zone. This game does not support SLI/NVLink or AMD's Crossfire, probably due to the terrible optimization. The game performs the same as one GPU regardless of having one or two GPUs or not.Stealth is poorly designed and broken. Enemies can detect you through a wall or will ignore the player when stealth killing in front of them and a well placed headshot with a silenced Overture revolver can one shot the majority of the enemies.The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions suffered from very blurry graphics prior to patch 1.3 and felt more like hopeless ports from a game released on previous console generations. Even worse, these versions are limited to 30FPS at most, even though the graphics are very downgraded in comparison to more powerful hardware versions. Even the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X versions don't fix this. Speaking of the PS4 version, it was removed from digital stores and later returned for 6 months, but if you go to the digital store the store page, it will warn you about playing the game on anything that isn't PlayStation 4 Pro or PlayStation 5.Although good for the most part, some of the dialogue is also very corny, such as Smasher’s \"You look like a cut of fuckable meat.\" The citizen NPCs have limited dialogue, which will get old fast. A lot of what they say doesn't make any sense, such as an NPC telling the player to \"feel good\" about themselves when held at gunpoint. And speaking of dialogue, the player is provided only a few seconds to choose a dialogue option before getting scolded at for not choosing fast enough, which is very annoying!The story itself is good and the first act does a fantastic job at making you feel for the characters and introducing you to Night City.Although Night City is big, there’s almost no interactivity with your surroundings outside of missions. Just like The Act Man said, “in Night City there’s a lot to see and fuck all to do”. The mini map is very imprecise as the trace can go nuts sometimes and other times it can make you do a thousand turnarounds for nothing. At least a lot of the missions are pretty fun to play through and many of them have some kind of interesting story to them.The gunplay can feel clunky at times, thanks to the often poor hit detection and cheap bullet sponge enemies. Melee combat is also especially trashy:Dodging attacks and crouching are mapped to the same button.The AI cheats, as they often land attacks even after dodging them (they'll punch or kick the air, and the game registers that as landing the hit), and often having invisible walls in front of them to prevent the player from quickly defeating them.Blunt weapons are really weak compared to blades, which are much quicker and overall better options for stealth play. Also some brawler enemies can block almost every melee weapon you’re using, including a machete. How can anyone block a machete?!The player will constantly receive messages and notifications on their phone. The problem is these messages will pause the game every time the player receives one, which severely disrupts the flow of the gameplay. A lot of the notifications are about things players most likely won't care about such as sales on specific cars.Now that the game has been revived, I still think it can be playable for the most part, as long as crashing doesn't occur EVERY NOW AND THEN. In fact the game has fully improved thanks to a lot of patches that saved the game and CD Projekt's reputation, and in addition the game's first (and possibly the only) expansion pack, Phantom Liberty, will be released in 2023 for PC and current-gen consoles.Graphically, the game looks very nice and has serious attention to detail even on the lowest settings and with the ray-tracing turned off. That is of course when all the objects are fully rendered, you can see polished objects, character models, or even Night City itself.The Xbox One and PS4 versions of the game since the 1.3 patch have looked and performed way better than they ever did. Patch 1.5 was released in February 2022, with optimization for the PS5 and Xbox Series. The PS5 version is much smaller (56 GB) than the PS4 version (100 GB). The same patch also fixes many bugs, improved AI, details, and much more. Patch 1.6, the \"Edgerunners\" update, was the final major update for old-gen consoles, adding cross-progression, Performance Mode for the Xbox Series S, and more customization.Despite the cumbersome weapons and bad AI (which was mostly fixed in 1.5), the combat can get pretty fun a lot of times. The weapons are fun to use and their sounds and animations are amazing. Johnny Silverhand's gun reload animation is nothing short of awesome.Despite some setbacks, the character customization is extremely detailed, with customization options ranging from tons of hairstyles to many different styles of eyes to even customizing V's genitals. In patch 1.5, the player can also change V's appearance by using the mirror at apartments and safehouses.Even if the optimization and performance are really bad, the ninth-generation versions via backward compatibility look and work definitely better, as they run at 60FPS without drops, though bugs, glitches, and crashes are still present. The loading screens are generally pretty short, even if they don't give enough time for the textures to fully load.Aside from some corniness, a lot of the dialogue is well-written and oftentimes pretty lengthy, detailed, and packed with lore. The first-person perspective helps in making these conversations feel more immersive.The soundtrack is fantastic and fits perfectly with the cyberpunk vibe and what is happening on the screen in general. In addition to this the voice acting is pretty great, especially with Mr. Keanu Reeves (of Matrix and Speed and John Wick fame) as Johnny Silverhand being a standout, along with a good variety of likable characters, Judy Alvarez, Jacky Wells and Goro Takemura being standouts. And of course, don't forget about Silverhand's most memorable line of the game, \"Wake the f__k up, Samurai, we have a city to burn.\"I really hope this game ceases crashing very soon if these issues are resolved. And another highly important thing, video game industry: NO MORE RUSHING A GAME'S DEVELOPMENT. Even the best games ever made have not even been rushed in the slightest. You are not supposed to rush a game for its deadline or whatever reason if you want it to be the greatest.Overall, though it may be revived and repaired very soon (I hope; please, I don't want this game to continuously crash on PlayStation all the time), an awesome game.",

    "review_description": "There are only a few months left before a whole new generation of consoles are released, and Rockstar has come to take this generation out with a bang; and that bang is called Grand Theft Auto V.The name itself shakes the gaming industry to its core. We all have our memories with the series. Assassinating a Chinese Mafia head by planting a bomb in his car with 8 Ball, driving around the beautiful islands in Vance’s white sports car, taking over turfs with Sweet, or bowling with Brucie. We’ve done it all in Rockstar’s open-world crime series.Rockstar took a more serious tone with Grand Theft Auto IV, striking out all the satire that San Andreas introduced us to. With Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar wants to maintain a balance between the satire, and the serious and it works out beautifully.Grand Theft Auto V is the first in the series to have three playable protagonists that you can switch to at any time in the open-world, or in the missions that have more than one protagonist taking part. The crew includes Michael, a now-retired bank robber, living in a luxurious house with a dysfunctional family. Franklin, a hustler living in South Central Los Santos, looking for the big break; and Trevor, the maniacal, unpredictable nut job.Through a prologue, we meet Michael and Trevor, 10 years before the events of the game, together in a bank job. The game wastes no time throwing you right into the action. After killing some cops, and evading some cop cars, and killing some more cops, the crew finds itself in a sticky situation. One of the crew members dies, Michael gets shot, and Trevor has to escape by himself. Michael then fakes his death in order to quit the game and live peacefully with his family.Skip to 10 years later, Michael living his retired life with a rebellious daughter, a no-good son, and a cheating wife, Franklin doing repo jobs for a car showroom, and Trevor running his guns and drugs business out in the countryside. The way these characters are introduced to each other in the story feels very smooth, and their interactions are some of the best cut-scenes in the game.The story itself has a weird pace to it that I never got comfortable with. It can wind up, and then let up in less than 2 hours, then wind up again. I didn’t know what the overarching story of the game was until maybe 60% in, and it all concludes too hastily. More could’ve been done with the characters, and I was left feeling unsatisfied with Franklin, especially.Of course, when a crew of misfits get together, there’s bound to be blood; and soon you’ll find yourself in need of money to pay-off a major mafia head from killing you.How you get that money is through heists. Newly introduced to the series, the heist missions let you choose the type of heist, the crew, and sometimes the equipment. They introduce a sense of flexibility previously not present in GTA games; that means the outcome of the missions can vary based on the quality of the crew and equipment that you chose. The handful of missions themselves are the most fun and memorable missions in the game.Other missions have you doing tasks that feel appropriate for the character. Eliminating the ludo-narrative dissonance problem that has plagued every open-world game to date. So, Michael will be visiting his therapist, Franklin will be helping his cousin’s addict girlfriend, Trevor will be selling guns to the Chinese triad. It all feels very natural.Those that had a problem with GTA IV‘s stiff driving mechanics will be happy to be know that GTA V takes a more arcade-like, loose approach to driving. The driving, shooting, flying, and traversing all feel good. However, I found myself befuddled by some of the game’s old design choices. In a world that games like Saints Row IV and Infamous exist, sometimes driving across the whole map in a slow-ass truck feels weirdly nostalgic. Like this is how games used to be!Outside of missions, there are tons of things to be done. There are Strangers and Freaks missions, there are activities and past-times, there are properties to buy and run, there is the internet in which you can buy stocks, check your equivalent of Facebook and Twitter, or watch online videos, there are street races, off-road ATV/Bike races, parachuting challenges, hunting, drug-trafficking… the list goes on and on. Not all of them are fun, but nonetheless, you will always have things to do in San Andreas.San Andreas itself is humongous, filled with details, vibrant and alive, and gorgeous to look at. It’s a shame that most of the time driving your eyes will be glued to the mini-map, missing all the glorious vistas and sights.Rockstar has successfully made another great GTA game, with enough new elements and twists to keep you playing through its long story. The heists are a wonderful addition to the series, and the 3 playable protagonists introduce a new dynamic that could be the next big thing with open-world games. While it’s not the best in the series, it is one hell of a game to ride out these last few months with our old consoles.",

    "review_description": " The RadWell told story.Lots of stuff to do.Looks great, sounds great.The BadIsn’t as funny as it probably thinks it is.Mission waypoint issues. I’ve gotta admit, I wasn’t particularly sure about it.I mean I liked GTA IV but it wasn’t without issues.And I feel like Saints Row was scratching the open world, crime game itch just fine, at least until it went delightfully insane and became something else entirely.GTA V isn’t something else entirely.It feels like it was largely built upon the ideas present in GTA IV, but it has few of that games flaws that I can recall.But I’m getting ahead of myself I guess.Unlike previous games in the series GTA V gives you three characters and for the most part this works great. You could argue Franklin isn’t as fleshed out as he could be, whilst Trevor and Michael steal a lot of the screen time - but all the characters are likeable enough.Over the course of the first few hours the game will introduce the various characters, as well as the switching mechanic that allows you to jump between them. There are missions where it is handy to swap, there are missions where you’re obligated to swap. And during free roam there are times where you’ll have to swap to a specific character to do their own, specific missions to progress.When you switch characters the game zooms out to a overhead, satellite view of the gameworld and then back in on the character you swapped to going about there business. For instance you might swap to Michael and find yourself waking up from dozing poolside, or swap to Trevor and find yourself surrounded by dead bodies. It’s a pretty awesome effect that gives the impression that the characters are actually doing stuff when you’re not controlling them, which goes a good way toward making me feel more immersed in the world.I wouldn’t be Grand Theft Auto without some uh, Grand Theft Auto.And there are plenty of vehicles to jack though I felt less inclined to do so here, as characters start with their own specific vehicles and for the most part they are fine.GTA IV had some vehicular control issues, but I feel like they’ve been rectified here. Cars don’t handle as arcadey as they might in say, Saints Row. They feel like they move with real weight. But at the same time they’re nowhere near as clunky as they were and they don’t take anywhere near as long to get a handle on. As far as shooting stuff goes by default the game retains the lock-on system of the last game. You CAN choose to free aim, but I tried for maybe thirty minutes or so and found the handling unwieldy. Locking on works fine and you always at least have some control of how high or low you’re aiming, so you can go for headshots if need be. New to the series is the concept of “heists” which tend to be the larger, more set-piece orientated missions. I feel like a lot of pre-release stuff and reviews put too much emphasis on this part of the game. I mean the heist missions are great, but everyone made it sound like these made up the bulk of the game. They don’t. There are maybe four or five of them.In heist missions you’ll be given some choices about how to proceed with them. Basically you’ll either go in silently, cleverly or in the front, loud, with guns. On heists you’ll get to hire getaway drivers, gunmen and hackers to help you out. Better skilled men take more of the cut, but increase your odds of success - so when building a crew you’ll probably try to make a balanced crew of expensive, trained guys and cheap rookies. The thing is that as you use crew members on the various heists, they’ll skill up and get better at what they do. But their pay stays the same. So if you pick the crappy hacker for your first mission, but stick with ‘em for the rest of the game it’ll pay off eventually. Ammu-nation returns as a place you can purchase weapons from if need be but with little exception you’ll get them given to you over the course of the game as you do the missions and I never ran out of ammo or felt fragile enough to procure a bullet proof vest, so their presence felt a little pointless - except that some of them have shooting ranges which can be fun distractions.And the game has a lot of fun distractions.Gun ranges aside you can also do some parachuting, yoga, run in triathlons, play tennis, golf, race jet skis, race cars, go hunting, visit a strip club, play the stock market and probably more that I ain’t recalling.And in addition to these activities there are also Red Dead Redemption-esque random encounters, which’ll usually involve killing someone or driving someone somewhere. I had more fun with it then it probably seems like you would have, but I had more fun with a lot of the above than you might think.I don’t know how much of an audience there is for playing golf in a GTA game, but I know you can count me in it. For as much as I enjoy the missions and the story and indeed, they are the draw - I enjoyed the all of the side activities and distractions.I know not everyone will play the way I do, but the way I approached the game I essentially roleplayed the character and went out of my way to do shit they might do outside of missions and had a blast playing it that way. Most mightn’t miss that stuff if they were gone, but they’re things that make it easier for me personally to immerse myself in the world which to me at least is as important in a GTA game as any of the story stuff.Aside from having a lot to do and playing great, the game looks and sound great too. Voice acting is terrific across the board and it’s amazing how good the game world looks for being as huge as it is. They went all out with the details and it paid off.Now for the bad stuff, but they’re minor points in my book.Firstly whilst most of the game holds your hand and tells you exactly where mission objectives are as you are accustomed to, there are some that give you vague directions or locations without really telling you where said location is.For instance I don’t think it’s too great a spoiler to say that playing Trevor you’ll get side quests to catch or kill some bail jumpers. The lady will tell you there’s a fellow at the quarry for instance, but I have no idea where the quarry is. The game hasn’t told me. I’ve driven around a while and not seen any signs to point me the right way. I’ve heard you can look it up on the map that came with the game, but all I can think is that it’s gonna be a bummer in the future for the poor sap that buys the game used and it lacks said map.And also the games humor. Firstly a lot of it is sexist and misogynist. Which isn’t a problem to me exactly. I’m not offended, I’ve never been offended and am of the opinion that it’s often hard to be funny WITHOUT offending SOMEONE.But there’s a lot of that humor there. Given the current prevailing attitude regarding stuff of that nature I’ve kind of gotta hand it to Rockstar for having the balls to have that stuff there and not kowtow to popular opinion. MY problem is that it just isn’t very funny. I maybe chuckled at a couple of lines, but not as much as I feel like they wanted me to. There were good, humorous character moments I liked but the stuff on the radio is where most of the “offending” material is and it just doesn’t do anything for me. I’d go as far as saying it feels out of place. Thankfully it does little to detract from the overall experience and I currently struggle as to whether I’ve not I’ve had better. I adore this game. I think if you liked GTA IV you’ll like this. I think if you didn’t like GTA IV you should probably still give it a look, because I wasn’t so big on that game either and I feel this a vast improvement.",

The controls are really easy, the driving is good in it and the most important one is the missions are quality on it. I just did a mission when I had to rob a jewellery store and you had to escape on bikes and go down the sewers it felt like the Italian Job. Its Brilliant and I really can't wait for when the online comes out on it! When the online comes out on it I'm sorry my friend but this game will be the best game every made. So if you haven't got GTA V I will go and get it now unless everywhere Is sold out.Best game ever.JakeMoore1106",

    "review_description": " The Grand Theft Auto series is one of the biggest in video games and Rockstar proves that a franchise doesn’t need to saturate the market by having a new game release every year. It has been five years sense Grand Theft Auto IV and although Rockstar has made other games in that time, the world of GTAV alone feels like they have been working on this game that whole time. As of GTA IV, Rockstar went for more of a series tone with the franchise and it didn’t fit well with all the anarchy that players could get into. Now with GTAV the story is serious again and this time told in a more exciting way which lends itself to having some lighthearted moments that mix with the serious moments smoothly without feeling out of place for the most part. The story works well and that is helped by some of the best characters in the series and once again great depth to the world around you, but GTAV still leaves room for improvement with the characters as well as how things work in the world. Instead of playing as one character running amuck across town, this time you take on the role of three different characters. You are introduced to all three characters over the first few hours of the game one at a time, getting a small piece of their lives while doing so and learning a little about them. There is Michael, who was a career criminal that has now slowed down, retired from the life with his wife and kids in Los Santos, which is game's version of Los Angeles. He has been spending his time bored out of his mind sitting around his house drinking; meanwhile his wife and kids hate him. Then there is Franklin, who is a low rent gangster. He and his best friend Lamar are the more typical style for this kind of gang as they are doing basic crimes trying to step up to bigger things. Franklin and Lamar at the time though are working for a crooked car dealer stealing cars for him, which is what leads to the meeting between him and Michael. From there the main story really starts going as Michael takes Franklin under his wing and they start working together and making a name for themselves, at least enough to catch the attention of Trevor, who is an old partner in crime of Michaels. Trevor is your typical loose canon, basically his whole life is lead by acting out like when you get bored in a GTA game and run around causing havoc. He swears, drinks and kills as he pleases with little remorse. His main gig is running a meth lab operation in the country/deserted area north of Los Santos. Trevor has spent the last ten years thinking Michael is dead until now, leading him into town to see for himself that Michael is still alive. This leads to a shaky and uneasy relationship between these three characters. Rockstar has done a great job of making it easy to switch between these three characters, unless you are in the middle of a mission. Some missions are for just that one character you have selected, while others are for two or maybe all three. Most of the time you can switch to any of the three you’d like and be introduced to whatever is going on in their life at that time. You can switch to Michael as he wakes up screaming from night terrors or walking out of a coffee shop throwing his cup on the ground. You can switch to Franklin playing with his dog Chop or trying to keep his friends from fighting or you can switch to Trevor puking into fountains or in his underwear chasing girls out of the strip club. It is nice giving the idea that all three of these guys are out living their lives even when you are not controlling them at all. The mission structure is pretty standard for a GTA game. There is a letter on the map that pops up and you drive to it, have a little cut scene and most likely end up driving someplace else to really get going. Some missions have multiple parts to them as well. Those types of missions usually end up mixing it up with one or two of the other main characters from the game. For example there is a chain of missions were Franklin is boosting unique cars and Trevor comes in to help and they take off with the cars on the back of a truck down the highway and as Trevor you have to try getting away from the police that catch on. However you can’t shake them so the game has you switch to Franklin to climb into a \\car on the back of the truck, drop it off the back and shoot the police are that are in pursuit. There are other missions where the characters find themselves in a shoot out and you can switch between them making it kind of tactical when it needs to be. This also plays into the game’s special abilities and stats for each character. All the characters have a list of stats for things like driving, shooting and energy. Again for example, Trevor is better at shooting then Franklin. However stats like the shooting don’t make any difference seeing that there is an auto-aim that makes picking off enemies (or the police) just as easy for everyone. The only statistic that seems to make any difference is the character specialty ones. Each has their own, such as Trevor goes into a rampage-esque mode and takes less damage, Franklin can use his while driving and slows down time to make better moves on the road and Michael has the ability to become more focused when in a firefight, having kind of a Max Payne feel to it, but not as dramatic. These all come in handy, however when it comes to the combat oriented ones if you use the cover system along with the previously mentioned auto-aim you will easily make it out of most encounters with enemies. There are times that missions deviate from the normal style such as when your crew takes on different heists. These missions take some extra planning and happen at pivotal points in the main story. These missions usually start out by getting information on the building or area you are going to have the heist happen and then choosing a “Plan A” or “Plan B” and depending on which you decide on you will make plans from there. You can play a sloppy way that is more dangerous or a more laid out plan that is less risky and makes for a more smooth in and out situation. From there you choose a crew (outside of the main three characters). You will higher a shooter, hack and a driver. Some of these missions you won’t need all three, maybe one or two. You will choose these people on their stats and those with higher stats will cost more money that is received from the heist. If you choose a shooter that is not as experienced he might die during the job and the money he was caring is gone and taken out of the total at the end. However, whoever you choose and make it through the mission the stats can go up, but the percentage of their take will stay the same. So it is possible to use inexperienced people and keep from paying them more as they get better. Some heists will need extra steps to complete before starting the heist. Maybe the job requires masks, clothing and weapons. You can have one of the main characters go buy it all or have one of each do a few steps making it feel like it was a team effort to get everything set up. You will sometimes also need to get yourself a getaway car and find a good place to stash it for once the job is done you can get away easily and quickly. Sometimes the job will call for specific vehicles like garbage trucks or maintenance vans and you will have to steal those as part of the set up. All this is a nice and welcome changed from the typical mission structure of the GTA series and they come a long just in time to keep things fresh and different. The only complain about this is there should have been a lot more of these types of missions. So you have your story missions and heists and of course there are side events. Outside of that there are random events that pop up when you are cruising around, these are usually simply things like someone stealing a purse from a woman or stealing a car. You can stop these from happening and do one of two things, keep the money you pick up or keep the vehicle that you get from the thief. After all you are playing as one of three criminals in their own right. There are also missions referred to as \"Strangers and Freaks\". These missions have little structure to them, but just enough to be something different. They are pretty typical for an open world game and each character have different events that unfold from them. Trevor for instance runs into some border control nut jobs in the desert bent on locking up whoever they assume is an illegal alien. Michael lets some random woman talk him into a footrace and Franklin gets mixed up with a weirdo that wants to get marijuana legalized. It is missions like this that keeps GTAV down to earth and brings in some humor. It keeps the game from feeling too serious all the time. There are also other things to do like street racing what not to do in the world, like any game of this caliber. Of course there is the simplest thing to do like joy ride around and see how long you can last with five wanted stars. As mentioned and of course expected there is a ton of driving that happens in this game. Unfortunately Rockstar still doesn’t seem to grasp the concept of gravity when it comes to the driving. The GTA series sense turning into a third-person game in GTA3 has had an awful time with the driving. Even now in GTAV it feels like you’re driving on icy roads while there is hardly any gravity. It is something that you do get use to, but really shouldn’t have to after all this time. I hate to bring it up, but the Saint’s Row series has had a better handle on driving the entire time compared to the GTA series. Also the flying is still a problem and like driving only becomes bearable after getting use to it. Although, when it comes to flying there is also the landing which is even more of a chore. Landing a plan in GTAV reminded me of trying to land a fighter jet on the aircraft carrier in Top Gun of the NES. GTAV is by far the best game in the series. Rockstar is so great a creating a world to live in and great characters to play as and they have out done themselves here once again. Driving is the only real downer about this game and even though you shouldn’t have to get use to it, once you do it works pretty well. There is also an online component to the game, but that is not out until October 1st. With all that GTAV offers though it is alright for Rockstar to take their time and get the online done right. There is no need to rush it with some much in the world already. GTAV might not be as surprising as it seemed like it would be, playing as more then one character and having such a huge open world, but it still makes it the best. I can see already other games trying to bring in the multiple main character aspect that GTAV has and they already perfected it as far as I am concerned. I just wish that GTAV came out earlier to help get through the summer drought of no game releases, but it is here now and worth picking up right away. It will also keep those afloat for awhile that don’t plan picking up next-gen systems anytime soon.",

    "review_description": "I’m not a big fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, I’ll admit. I always found it too focused on expanding the open sandbox elements when clearly they’re trying to create memorable stories. While none of the games are necessarily bad, they suffer greatly with both the lack of true narrative focus and a dissonance between redemptive characters and the player’s lust for destruction. Well, leave it to the fifth main entry to finally bring a balance. Grand Theft Auto V is everything great about the series packed into one game: a fantastic narrative with memorable characters, a vast open world with a slew of fun activities, tight and responsive gameplay, and amazing visuals. And as a plus, we have the great satire and parody the series is famous for, which is more biting and hilarious this time around. The story follows not just one, but three main characters in a bold move on the developer’s part. The first is Michael De Santa, a highly skilled former bank robber now trying to retire from his life of high crime with his dysfunctional family of a lazy gamer, a slutty daughter, and a cheating wife. He has trouble coming to terms with his new life, and circumstances force him to once again enter into robbing. Next is Franklin Clinton, a gangster from the hood who wants to move up from petty crimes to a more lucrative criminal lifestyle. He lives with his aunt in a run-down house, does jobs with his funny, but dumb friend Lamar, and starts off by doing repossession jobs for a middle-eastern car dealer. He gets thrust into Michael’s shenanigans early on, and soon realizes that the life of high-class crime is much more brutal than he thinks. The final one is Trevor Phillips, who’s perhaps the best character in this game. He’s a psychopathic, emotionally unstable meth-head who’d just as likely kill you as try to become your friend. His violent tendencies, along with his surprisingly sharp observations of the degrading culture of Los Santos, make him the best realization of a Grand Theft Auto character yet. He might not be relatable in any sense, but he’ll entertain you right up to the end credits. The presentation, as expected from Rockstar, is nothing short of breathtaking. The scenery in Los Santos is shown off in exquisite detail. From the mountain range to the city to even the desert regions, every location is richly detailed and vibrant. With the gigantic map that Rockstar has built here, each of these places are meant to be explored and seen, with terrific views anywhere you look. Though the graphics are showing their age, being nothing special in terms of up-close detail, everything remains solid and beautiful no matter what distance you look at it from, if a little murky at times. And all without lag, little texture pop-in, or a single loading screen, so you remain fully immersed in the experience. The animation quality is also top-notch. Every person in Los Santos acts like a real person in the way they hold natural conversations, walk places, and interact with others. It feels more realistic compared to previous entries in the series considering how smooth everything looks. Not to mention the more dynamic lighting and weather effects. The game is meant to look beautiful, and Rockstar has pulled all the stops to make sure it does. What really sets this entry from previous ones is its much sharper and wittier writing. As a hyper parody of our real world, nothing is left sacred in Grand Theft Auto V’s wake. It criticizes everything from politics, U.S. government tactics against terrorists, corruption of law enforcement, and corporate greed. All of these things come alongside the reckless robbery, driving, murdering, and general mayhem the series has become infamous for. It brings about a humor to it that can be viciously funny at times. It also includes moments that make you realize how real these situations are. I felt uncomfortable during one scene, which I won’t spoil, because it shows off something that I know is happening now within our own country. Some will criticize the writing for not taking a side on certain issues, thus rendering it not actual satire. But I argue that satire need not take a side in order to be effective. It just shows the situation in an overblown fashion, causing people to make up their own mind, and that’s the true genius of this game. Of course, the narrative is there as well, and it’s a damn fine crime drama that deserves to be in league with the likes of Ocean’s Eleven and Heat. The dramatic moments are tense, the dialogue is intelligent, and the characters all have a chemistry that cannot be imitated anywhere else, even with the amazing side characters that come out of this. There are even times where things get emotional, though not to the heights seen in Red Dead Redemption or L.A. Noire, two of Rockstar’s finest narrative tales. Everything moves along at a perfect pace, right down to a meaningful choice at the end. But where is the gameplay in all of this? Because that’s what’s most important in any game, right? Well thankfully, Rockstar has kept the same gameplay as previous games, but with many tweaks to ensure that this is the smoothest gameplay you’ll ever experience with their games. The movement controls have always been simple. You tilt the analog stick to walk, hold a button to run, simple as that. Nothing too complicated there. You can use guns here, and it basically has the same system as Red Dead Redemption, where you choose weapons from a wheel and take cover behind objects. The cover is sticky here, and doesn’t get in your way whenever you want to move from cover to cover. There’s the same auto-aim feature here that gets a lot of flak for making fights too easy, but this can easily be changed in the settings to a free-aim for additional challenge. There are many different types of missions, each having unique objectives and goals despite an initially similar premise for some of them. There will be shootouts, races, and assassination missions to undertake, as usual. But the newest addition is the heist mission, which are by far the grandest and most entertaining parts of the game. You start off with scoping out the place of interest to pinpoint weaknesses in security. Once that’s taken care of, you go to a safe house where the plan gets written out. You have the choice of going in loud and dumb, or finding more clever routes without attracting as much heat. Each choice has several setup missions to go on before the main event, as well as picking a crew member with varying stats. Picking someone with low stats will have a lower pay grade, but could cost you a lot of money. On the flip side, those who ask for more money will generally be more skilled and could make the heist go smoother. It gives you reasonable choices to go with, and seeing the plan go off is nothing short of exciting, especially with Grand Theft Auto’s special brand of over-the-top scenarios to keep things both fun and challenging, especially when the heat starts swarming in. The Wanted system is back as well, with cops being just as hyper-aggressive as in previous games. Their goal is to stop your anarchic rampages at all costs, and will shoot you down on sight no matter what. As things escalate, helicopters, SUVs, and military personnel will join the fray, making escape less of an option. Cops are still fun to mess around with, even if they waste you and send you to the hospital. However, regular enemies here should not be underestimated. They are relentless. They will shoot you on sight, and are always aiming to kill. They can easily be brought down with several bullets to the body or a well-placed headshot, but don’t ever think they can’t bring you down. You will die if you’re not careful. This is where checkpoints come in. In previous Grand Theft Auto entries, if you died or failed a mission objective, you restarted the entire mission as the penalty, resulting in frustration. This doesn’t happen here. If you make it through a mission objective, but find yourself struggling with the next, you’ll restart at the point where the current objective began, easing the frustration and allowing you to focus on that rather than having to remember the first few minutes of a long mission, which there are many of here. Switching between three characters also provides some tactical advantages in the more brutal firefights. Instead of picking a spot and then moving when things get a little heated, you can instantly switch to a different character, where their vantage point can help the rest of your characters escape or fight back with some good kills. Switching happens even outside of missions. You can switch between Michael, Franklin, and Trevor easily. You get an aerial look of the city as it rushes to the character you picked. They can even be right across the map and you’ll be able to control them within seconds. You even get a small scene here and there giving a glimpse of what a character has been up to while they were under AI control. This is a true technical marvel, and doesn’t feel at all cumbersome. What Grand Theft Auto game is complete without driving, however? Unlike the previous game, where cars were difficult to turn and had poor acceleration, the cars here have had a tune-up and have much tighter handling. Going down the winding, complicated roads of Los Santos is smooth, with no unnecessary turns taken or needing to push hard on the analog sticks to make it take a sharp turn. Each vehicle has its own stats, much like in a racing game, and can be customized with parts at auto shops to improve their performance. You can even shoot weapons from a car, though the aiming system clashes often with the need to focus on the road, resulting in many unwanted accidents. You can even pilot aircraft such as airplanes and helicopters, though the controls for these veer on the awkward side. Planes feel loose and turning is dependent on more than one button, resulting in some early crashes. Helicopters bob and weave out of your control, no matter how high your flight skill is, and landing requires lots of playing around with the ascend/descend buttons. Speaking of flight skill, you can increase the stats of your characters, sort of like a mini-RPG. Doing side activities like golf, mountain biking, tennis, and even yoga—all of which are detailed enough to be their own game—can increase skills like stamina and strength. Doing regular things like driving and flying also increase your skills, though I didn’t really notice any truly significant chance between levels, so this feels kind of like a wasted opportunity. Several things in Grand Theft Auto V miss the mark, however, such as the underwater segments. Piloting a submarine to view the downright gorgeous ocean depths is fun on its own, but I would’ve like to see some sort of treasure hunting or salvage missions take place in these areas, as exploration gets boring after a while. Also, there are a few glitches here and there that come with the open-world game territory. Some are funny like driving invisible cars, and some can be frustrating like the disappearing safe house cars, where a tricked out car can suddenly vanish if put into a safe house garage. Also, there are fewer buildings that you can go into this time around apart from the main and side missions, and there are no restaurants to eat at as shops and vending machines take their place. Also, the radio kind of sucks this time around. Everything goes on a loop, with the occasional news story being changed depending on your actions in the game. The choice in music is also a letdown, as there are very few recognizable songs. Which is sad considering the actual score for the game is outstanding in its orchestration. These issues aside, nothing really takes away from the strengths of this game. The vast and lively open-world, tight gameplay, memorable characters, attention to detail, and stunning visuals all point to one thing: this is a fantastic game that everyone should try at least once. It’s a different, but familiar Grand Theft Auto experience, and has probably the strongest story in the series. Even if you’re skeptical of the game as I was, I urge you to put aside your prejudice against the game and give it a shot. I guarantee you it’ll feel much different and more satisfying. P.S. – There’s also the issue of the missing multiplayer component, which launches on October 1. While I admire Rockstar’s commitment to quality control, the fact that a key component of the game is missing at launch doesn’t feel right. I might do an update to this review when the multiplayer launches, but until then, I’m judging the game based on the single-player alone.",

    "review_description": "Rockstar has given players everything they want in a Grand Theft Auto game - which is why this installment might have been exceptional if it hadn't been limited to self-imposed series expectations.Grand Theft Auto V is a natural progression from the diamonds plot device of GTA IV, in which the stories of three protagonists over the course of the main game and DLC intersect. GTA V takes this plot device and expands it into the focal feature of the game: the ability to (nearly) instantaneously switch between three-player controlled protagonists both in the open world and during some missions. Open world switching can be entertaining - you could switch to Michael in the middle of him yelling at a cop, Franklin leaving a strip club, or Trevor waking up from a drunken stupor in his underwear in the posh Vinewood Hills. Mission switching works really well - you no longer have to pull out of cover with little health to try to find that one annoying baddie sniping you from above; you can simply switch to a protagonist with a different sight line to get the clear shot. This makes combat much more enjoyable and yet, most of the time enemies are still just running toward your reticle.This switching mechanic becomes fully realized in the incredible set of heists that your protagonists attempt to pull off. You are often asked to make choices on how you want the heist to go down. You can go in stealthy, in disguise and hope no one is the wiser, or go in guns blazing, taking your loot by force. You then get to choose your crew members - hired henchmen that can be your gunman, driver, or hacker with stats that can be leveled up the more you use them. Once you've set your plan, you go out into the open world and grab whatever items are needed to conduct the heist. This is an incredible system that sadly is sorely underutilized, comprising maybe a fifth of the game.The rest of GTA V feels like a retread of past games in the series. The mission structure too often is drive to the mini-map icon, cutscene, drive to yellow dot, cutscene, shoot some people briefly, drive to yellow dot. The missions are oddly ordered - too often you have to drive to the other side of the city to get the next mission rather than having missions be clustered in one area. There's no structure establishing a sense of who lives in which neighborhood of the city and what those particular resident's concerns and needs might be. Also, I found myself switching characters just to see who was closest to a mission and after the first quarter of the game, there was no guarantee the character would be near their safe house. There are, predictably, a lot of minigames and side activities that are mostly terrible and maybe tolerable because it's just ridiculous that they're there. There are some side missions that are little vignettes with supporting characters who are caricatures rather than actual characters. There's also the not so subtle and tired satire on the radio and in cutscene dialogue.The story is mostly okay but is a steep downgrade from the compelling narrative and characters of Niko's story. Michael and Franklin's motivations are never fully realized. Franklin's story, in particular, barely touches the depths of CJ's from GTA: San Andreas and is extremely cliched and disappointing. Trevor can act inconsistently and seemingly for the hell of it, which is fine, but we aren't given a chance to find out what led him to be this way or why certain emotions arise around women. The tone fluctuates wildly at times, mostly landing on silly and absurd.Grand Theft Auto V did not need to be a GTA game. Rockstar's failure to focus on the heists in favor of the same old missions, minigames, and desire to insult every race, gender, and stereotype felt more like a need to appeal to what fans expect from the series rather than surprising them with what they didn't know they wanted. The story and tone felt forced to appease fans who expressed disgust with the seriousness of GTA IV. The game never seemed to have a direction or a reason for why we were following these three protagonists. But the switching mechanics and heist missions are just that awesome that I would still recommend this game to others even if the Grand Theft Auto series formula may be showing its age.",

    "review_description": " Grand Theft Auto V is the rare game that never quite succeeds in any one aspect, but still uses it’s disparate parts to add up to an interesting – if flawed – whole. A confused, haphazard narrative and mechanics that feel somewhat outdated mar what is otherwise probably the most refined ‘sandbox’ game to date, one that fully embraces that description. The most discussed change in this installment is the addition of multiple player characters: Michael, a washed up old thief; Franklin, an ambitious young street hustler; and Trevor, an amoral lunatic. It’s an interesting idea that allows for some clever moments, but aside from some special abilities there’s no difference in gameplay between the three – missions will almost always involve driving somewhere and/or shooting people. In the missions where the protagonists come together, you can switch between them – but only at certain points, which are easy enough to spot because the game will keep making a beeping noise at you until you switch. Doing so can provide a better vantage point (or you may find yourself surrounded by enemies, so be careful) while failing to switch often means the other character will die, forcing you to restart the mission. Ultimately it just becomes a way of getting the player to another part of the mission without making them run all the way over there. Efficient, but nothing groundbreaking. Excellent voice work aside, by the end, you'll just want them to stop talking.The narrative that binds these three men together, on the other hand, is probably the worst part of the game. While it starts out promisingly enough, the story is quickly bogged down by the problems that have become typical of Rockstar games. Too often it's never really clear why the protagonists are doing something other than that it creates an excuse for something crazy to happen. They just sort of go along with whatever they're told to do, by literally anyone, and then complain about doing it. Which is weird, but fine – after all, game stories are for nothing if not justifying the action. Compounding that is the fact that very few characters are likeable or interesting, with many supposedly standing in as some sort of ironic portrayal of lazy stereotypes – to the point that some of them just stand there and announce what their stereotype is, and then have nothing else to say. And the rest are just different types of asshole. Even this isn’t too big a deal, and it occasionally works, right up until the game makes you listen to people yell and argue with each other about absolutely nothing, often for the entire mission. In almost all the missions. It’s understandable as to why they have characters continue conversations as you drive from point A to point B. You want to have some way of showing all these people interacting with each other. However, I could probably count the number of conversations that didn’t involve anyone screaming or loudly complaining on one hand, and there is a lot of talking in this game. And that goes for the actual cutscenes, not just the incidental dialogue. It quickly becomes incredibly irritating, to the point that I would avoid doing missions just to get a chance to relax. What’s more, at about the halfway mark, they stop saying anything new. Everyone keeps on yelling at each other, but they’re essentially just saying the same things, over and over again. It’s extremely bizarre, as if at some point they stopped writing new dialogue and just decided to splice in the unused takes from earlier scenes, sprinkling in a little plot-specific info just to be safe. But this same problem occurred to a certain extent in Red Dead Redemption, a previous Rockstar game, as well, so it’s clearly a deliberate decision, which makes it all the more baffling. Even after you get used to driving, you'll spend a fair amount of time crashing into everything.As far as actually playing the game goes, it’s a little rough, but it works. The game has a finicky control scheme, with everything – movement, shooting, driving – requiring just a little more precision than the gamepad is capable of, and making any combination of those three things nigh impossible. The game isn’t difficult by any means, but it’s probably telling that it not only has an ‘aim the gun for you’ option, but allows you to skip mission sections entirely after failing several times in a row. The weird thing about GTA V is that somewhere in between the slightly awkward controls and grating characters is a pretty fun game. There’s one mission in particular that clarifies just what manages to be so appealing underneath it all. Trevor and Michael are robbing a train, and the climax of the sequence involves boats, cars and helicopters all thrown in together in a ridiculous jumble. The whole thing just felt like some kid messing with his toys, which is precisely what so much of the appeal in GTA is. Just as Minecraft is a virtual Lego set, the island of Los Santos is a giant playbox, one that just happens to be a particularly stunning approximation of Los Angeles. All the supposedly mature, edgy material is a distraction from what makes this game fun, be it throwing cars around in the city, flying over mountains or playing cops and robbers. I have yet to go through the Online Mode, but the general impression I’ve gotten is that it capitalizes on this aspect of the game much more readily, simply because this is the kind of thing that works best with friends. Heists provide an all-too-brief glimpse of the game's full potential.It’s hard to shake the feeling Rockstar isn’t quite sure what to do with the series, though. The game is crammed full of half-baked parodies of pop culture and leisure activities that don’t really contribute anything to the experience, while any attempt at playing the game means you have to listen to another character talk about how awful all the things you’re doing are. Simply calling themselves out on the illegal or immoral activities in the game only comes across as an awkward attempt on the developer's part to make it more palatable, but feels half-hearted and unnecessary. They don’t seem interested in letting go of the attention they get from that debate, either. A much discussed segment midway through the game requires the player, as Trevor, to torture an innocent person. It’s made obvious this sequence accomplishes nothing for the characters, and immediately afterwards Trevor launches into a tirade about how torture is ineffective. The whole thing comes off as a cheap attempt at stirring up controversy, with some extra dialogue thrown in to give them an out. It’s not offensive, just boring. Only once did the game ever make me feel truly uncomfortable. A late game sequence requires Michael to take out some gangsters that have been messing with Franklin. It’s no different than any of the dozens of other missions, really. You drive to a place and shoot some guys. But when it’s a middle aged white man approaching a group of young men hanging out on a basketball court and immediately mowing them down, you begin to wonder just what kind of game Rockstar thinks it’s putting together. Whether you’re cruising city streets or fleeing into the desert, there’s fun to be had here, but most likely it’s going to be of your own making. ",

    "review_description": "Grand Theft Auto III was a transformative game for me. I was obviously too young to play it, my parents knew that, but I was able to obtain a copy and play it in its entirety none the less. I really do believe that the experience of playing that game turned me into the game enthusiast that I am today. That’s the baggage any game carrying the name Grand Theft Auto carries with it: equal parts hype and dread. I’m happy to say GTA V lives up to it’s name entirely. It expands on what you want it to, but still remaining extremely game-y. It doesn’t attempt to be as “realistic” as Call of Duty, or so many other games that have been moving towards realism. It’s perfectly fine to let you have more guns than ever, crazy car crashes that you can usually walk away from, and police that aren’t quite as vindictive as they are in the real world. But outside of that, Rockstar continues to show that they are one of two or three studios active today that understands how to make a character.Every GTA game takes a lot of inspiration from a particular type of movie, or a specific movie. Anyone who knows anything about V knows that it is taking a lot from Michael Mann’s classic movie Heat. That aspect gives GTA V some of it’s best moments. You get to go on heists, where you get to do all the prep, choose the approach, and feel like a criminal mastermind when you get away with it in the end. Which brings me to the next new mechanic: multiple characters. From a gameplay perspective, switching between characters makes the multi character missions that much more fun. There’s never a dull moment. When one character’s activities cool down, another heats up, you switch seamlessly and keep going. From a plot perspective, having each character not necessarily be a main character does a few things for you. It gives the sense that each of the three characters is living their own crazy lives. It lets each character have a specialty, bringing them down into reality a little bit more by not having one character who is basically a super hero. Most importantly, you can have the craziness of Trevor because it’s grounded in Michael and Franklin. Thankfully, all three main characters are fantastic in their own ways. Finally, the last piece of any GTA game is satire. They always satirize American culture, and yes it’s been done before, and starting to feel old and not as funny anymore. But the rest of the game, the main story for the most part, I don’t look at as satire or parody even though there is a good amount of humor. It’s all homage, and I look at it as more of a commentary on the heist genre and political thrillers at points than it is a critique of a American politics and cultures, and it pulls off those story beats as well as you can imagine. It puts together a great story, with very fun characters. It’s not depressing like GTA IV, it is just fun the whole way through.The mechanics, story and characters come together to form an amazing overall experience. The game is a lot of fun to play, and the GTA controls are better than ever, even though that control scheme comes off as very aged after playing Sleeping Dogs last year, but it works more than well enough to convey its entertaining and mature story.",

    "review_description": "Open-world crime games have come a long way since the bird’s-eye view carjacking escapades of DMA Design’s 1997 cult hit Grand Theft Auto. Titles like Saint’s Row and Sleeping Dogs have bolstered our expectations of the once-novel genre and we expect bigger, better versions of our preferred franchises with each installment. It had been five long years for fans since Rockstar blew everyone away with Grand Theft Auto IV and now that the newest incarnation is here, I can’t help but wonder if five years was long enough.By all accounts, GTA V is a very good game. It offers the (mostly) realistic world fans of the genre have been clambering for while still retaining the polish we have come to expect from Rockstar. Why change up a winning formula?The game’s story begins with a flashback to a heist from nine years ago. Michael Townley, Trevor Phillips, and two accomplices botch a job and end up in a shootout with police. Michael is shot, Trevor escapes, and the other two thieves are killed. The game then fast-forwards to present time and puts players into the shoes of the stereotypical gangbanger Franklin, who does repossession jobs for a shady car salesman. In a chance meeting between Franklin and the now-retired Michael, the two bond over their criminal pasts and begin working together. Trevor, who believes Michael had died, notices his old crew’s calling card in a news story and attempts to track Michael down.The plot doesn’t overly impress, due to the typical crime tropes and story beats all making appearances, as well as a lacking payoff at its conclusion. Betrayals, insider trading, torture, government corruption, drug- and gun-rings, and other typical fare all show up to the party with Rockstar’s social commentary tacked on as an attempted justification for inclusion. Character development is lackluster as well, with frustrating stereotypes and questionable motives taking the place of possibly interesting arcs.Rather than one playable character, GTA V gives us three – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. While this concept does offer two extra perspectives on the workings of the criminal mind, it also overloads the player with side missions, activities, and random encounters. More is not always better and I found myself stressing out about missing story beats and time-based activities (as in visits to Michael’s therapist), as well as undertaking a number of stock market missions before I had sufficient money to do so.The amount of content here is staggering. Tennis, golf, and darts are all available to play and are surprisingly fun for the most part. Strip clubs (with a questionable, full-fledged groping mechanic), movie theatres, and televisions all provide alternate entertainment, while the standard fare like races and mayhem missions return.Side quests throughout San Andreas tend to be worth your time, which is very refreshing to see. Paparazzi missions see Franklin helping a scummy photographer taking pictures of celebrities while assassinations change the ups and downs of the incredibly robust stock market created by Rockstar. There is always something to do in GTA V and it is apparent that the development team created each activity with significant care.GTA V ditches the overly serious tone of IV, evoking the more playful, darkly comedic feel of San Andreas. The game features plenty of laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled with social commentary about America’s current issues. Several instances detract from the humor, however, through the liberal use of gore and depravity and I found myself cringing when Rockstar took this route – Trevor’s already-infamous torture scene is a strong example of crossing the line, and in no way contributes positively to the world so carefully crafted.GTA V features much better gameplay mechanics than previous incarnations of the franchise. Shooting and aiming are more on par with other open-world games, which is a huge step up from Grand Theft Auto IV‘s atrocious system. Driving and car handling are also vastly improved – no longer do vehicles handle like the world is frictionless. In many ways, GTA V feels like a more robust version of the previous games and more in touch with Rockstar’s grand vision.The gameplay is centered around the completion of heists, which are multiple-stage missions. The first step of each is planning, wherein the player chooses crew members with assorted stats to drive, gun, or hack. Each heist offers two different paths to take – generally a decision between stealthy or 80′s action movie style – and setup for either. Getaway cars must be acquired, equipment located, and the locations must be cased in order to attempt the mission. The heists were my favorite part of the game by far, but with only six or so throughout my forty-plus hour experience, I did feel let down. It is clear that Rockstar spent a great deal of time on these but I was left hungry for more.Graphically, the title is very impressive. Sunlight reflects off surfaces realistically and rain puddles shimmer like their real-life counterparts. Character models are strongly detailed and aside from occasional janky movement, are animated quite well. Rockstar’s focus on the smallest of details is something to be applauded as well – things like characters looking in their rear-view mirror when backing up and character-specific car-jacking animations.GTA V is very pleasant on the ears. A great musical selection over varied genres is a staple of the franchise’s awesome radio, and this game is no different. Music is important, but voice acting is paramount, and character dialogue is believable for the most part and well-executed.GTA Online, Rockstar’s newest multiplayer service, is an ambitious concept. A full story complete with voiced dialogue awaits when the servers are finally stabilized. Races, deathmatch, and heists are all available here. At the moment, the service is suffering from launch woes and is mostly unplayable, but it is a good reason to keep the game disc in your console.I can’t help but feel that as great as GTA V is (and it IS a blast to play), it suffers from its arrogance. Other open-world crime games have come and impressed us since IV‘s release and Rockstar seems to ignore them rather than monopolize on the competitive spirit. To really push the limits of the genre may not be in their grand scheme, but something needs to change if Rockstar hopes to maintain their reputation.Despite my criticisms, GTA V is undeniably a solid game and well worth playing. With an overabundance of activities and a substantial main story (not to mention GTA Online, when it finally works), this is a title worth your time and money – providing you know what you’re getting into. GTA V does not reinvent the genre, but it does build strongly on the legacy Rockstar has created for itself.",

    "review_description": "Considering the absurdly widespread popularity of Grand Theft Auto, Rockstar Games have to be commended for not falling into the standard pattern of sequelisation that many other developers working with extremely profitable games have. When Rockstar want to make a GTA game, they don’t just spit out a slightly more advanced version of something from the year before, they sit down and work on what they want to make for as long as it takes, and at the end produce a game that feels like a rich and full experience. This is truer than ever with Grand Theft Auto V, which stands up as one of the studio’s best works to date.Meet the gang.GTA V returns the series to the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas and revolves around three separate protagonists: Franklin, a black youth struggling to get by in the poorest part of the city of Los Santos; Michael, a wealthy resident of Los Santos’s equivalent of Beverly Hills, living with a cheating wife and ungrateful and spoiled children; and Trevor, a psychotic and controlling madman running his own meth business from the deserts of San Andreas. Michael and Trevor remain linked by a high-paying heist they pulled years before the main events of the game, while Franklin meets up with Michael after trying to repossess his son’s car for a crooked businessman. When the paths of these three characters meet, they are snatched up in a whirlwind of violent behaviour and elaborate crimes.The driving and shooting systems that are the tools of your trade on this crime spree are carefully tuned, and make even just moving from A to B or completing basic missions an exciting experience. The game adopts a more refined version of GTA IV’s cover-based shooting combat, in which you can lock onto the centre mass of nearby enemies, leaving a risk-reward situation where you can either try to gun them down with sheer firepower, or try to angle your reticule just the right amount upwards to get a headshot. At least, this is the default. For those who prefer other aiming modes, the option is there. Enemies drop fast, and on paper this combat system may seem devoid of challenge, but the accuracy required to score headshots, the sheer number of enemies, and the way your health only recharges up to a maximum of 50% keep firefights engaging. The feeling of getting just the right cover placement and quickly taking out multiple enemies in a row is one of the most satisfying parts of the gameplay.Franklin's ability in particular is a lot of fun. Each of the protagonists also has their own special ability that can be activated to give you a gameplay advantage for a limited period. Franklin can slow down time while driving and shift his car about the road with improved handling, Michael can slow down time when on foot allowing him to quickly and easily eliminate enemies, and Trevor can go into a furious rage to make himself impervious to damage. These abilities help add some extra colour to gameplay and are always exciting to use, but more impressive is the ability to switch between the characters at almost any time. Providing you’re not currently in a mission, you can select any of the three protagonists and the camera will zoom out of your location, fly across the map, zoom in on the character you selected, and let you begin playing from their perspective. I never got tired of performing these switches, and rejoining characters to find them in different places doing different things every time gives the sense that they actually have their own individual lives outside of your control. You can also switch between characters during the game’s “Heist” missions, using all three of them to complete larger jobs. For example, you might be able to control Michael or Franklin to shoot enemies on the ground, but be able to switch to Trevor to snipe at enemies from a helicopter. This feature adds an extra dynamic to the combat in these scenarios, and makes heist missions feel like a truly co-operative effort between characters, rather than one character being the central focus and two of them just feeling like tag-along NPCs.From the character transitions, to moving between missions, the game must be commended for having very few load times once you get past the title screen, and this is just one of its great technical achievements. With GTA V having been developed at the end of a console generation, some strong limitations were placed on what it could do technically, but Rockstar have proved here that for developers who really try to optimise their software, they can still push a game to perform beyond our preconceived expectations for current-gen titles. Of course GTA V doesn’t look or run like a next-gen title or a high-end PC game, but objects and people render with surprising realism, and the game is free of limited draw distances, texture pop-in, or a choppy framerate. The only major criticism I can give of the game’s graphics is that in-game television shows and movies suffer from pretty severe compression artefacts.GTA V's world is a thing to behold.One thing that shouldn’t be a surprise is that GTA V is big, but only by playing it do you truly get a sense of the way it dwarfs the worlds of previous Rockstar games. More importantly, it manages to pull off the grand trick of giving you the polish and detail of a linearly structured game, while retaining the freedom and grand scale of the open-world genre. No inch of the city of Los Santos looks the same, and from the shacks out in the sticks to the well worn roads of the motorways, close attention has obviously been paid to crafting every piece of the environments. San Andreas also has a silly amount of activities for the idle player to participate in outside of the main story, including golf, tennis, street races, boat races, air delivery missions, parachuting, yoga, watching the aforementioned TV shows and films, seventeen radio stations, an extensive in-game internet, strip clubs, two different stock markets to invest in, and a range of side missions. The state is so well-realised that it’s easy to lose yourself in the world to the point where you forget how far beyond other open-world games GTA V manages to go.This world and its characters remain inseparable, and while from an outside perspective it might seem like the protagonists are too obvious and straightforward to carry the story for its full length, through a combination of quality writing, talented voice performances, and life-like animation, Franklin, Michael, and Trevor all become interesting figures in their own right. Trevor was a personal favourite, with his unhinged dialogue and reckless behaviour being a regular source of entertainment. The use of multiple protagonists also ensures that you never get too bored with any one, and as time goes on, seeing the characters bite off a little more of the criminal life than they can chew leads to some engaging drama. The game’s jokes can sometimes fall flat, most frequently when they just try to mention something vulgar in place of actual humour, but on the whole, the grand parody of American culture that GTA V creates by lampooning ignorant socio-political views and empty consumerism, is welcome and amusing.Sometimes, the online component can just feel like a clunkier version of the single-player.Unfortunately, the online component of GTA V can’t quite reach the giddy heights of the single-player. The multiplayer has you create your own custom character and drops you into a version of San Andreas populated by other random players. You can then rank up and collect money to purchase properties, firearms, gun modifications, car modifications, and more, by participating in deathmatches and races with other players, as well as missions where one team tries to prevent another from completing a specific objective. The game’s driving and combat mechanics make the central experience of squaring off against other players mostly enjoyable, but faults in the surrounding systems start to undermine this.To enter any specific mission, race, or deathmatch you have to know exactly where in the world it’s triggered from and go to that location, or use the matchmaking service. Matchmaking allows you to enter random matches with other people, but there’s no way to refine your player search beyond the rather vague “Join a random race”, “Join a random mission”, etc. When you do find other players, the game has no compunctions about dropping you into matches that it claims are too difficult for your current rank. Representing a far cry from the smooth transitions of the single-player, these matches are bookended with waits caused by extended server hangs and lobbies with perplexingly long timers. Payouts of experience points and money from matches are also inconsistent and commonly disproportionate to the amount of time or effort you put in, meaning it can take hours in multiplayer to attain what are considered fairly basic items and privileges in single-player. Part of this might be an attempt on the game’s part to try and get you to purchase “GTA Bucks”, the game’s microtransaction currency.GTA V's multiplayer is at least another excuse to explore its wonderful environments.Outside of matchmade games, interactions with other players aren’t common unless you’re making a deliberate attempt to get together with friends online. Occasionally another player will have a bounty placed on them and you can pick up a cash reward for taking them out, or you may be able to find a random player and gun them down to steal money from them, but the size of the city is one major factor meaning that you’re unlikely to run into other people at any given time. It’s also worth noting that at the time of this writing people are still experiencing problems with losing their GTA Online characters or use of GTA Online corrupting single-player save files. Providing you’re using hard-saves and following the proper instructions, it’s unlikely that you’ll have any such problems, but none the less it’s not okay for these issues to exist in a retail game in any form. Along similar lines, I know I’m not the only player who occasionally gets spontaneously kicked from the servers due to connections issues on Rockstar’s end.In short, the single-player of Grand Theft Auto V offers an amazingly large-scale and refined take on the GTA formula, and in every facet, from design to execution, the game achieves great things. The online component bears some significant weaknesses, but it still provides something satisfying, and the problems with it can’t eclipse the overall fantastic job that has been done on GTA V.",

    "review_description": "Five long years have passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto IV, and numerous open-world games have been released during that time. Not all of these games were amazing, but specific games like Sleeping Dogs changed the way that open-world games are played. With the release of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games set out to prove that they are still the kings of the open-world genre, introducing a three-protagonist system and incorporating the random events of Red Dead Redemption.GTA V follows three main characters (Franklin, Michael, and Trevor) in their separate pursuits of getting rich and surviving in Los Santos and Sandy Shores. Trevor and Michael have history together, but Franklin is introduced to Michael after a car repossession gone terribly wrong in which Franklin endears himself to Michael. Franklin’s story seems the most like a standard GTA game during his early missions of hanging out with his OG-friend, Lamar, and helping out other characters in the hood, but Franklin’s life becomes very different once he begins helping Michael with heists and after meeting Trevor. There are a few major heists that must be completed during GTA V’s story, and they are the most entertaining aspect of the game. Each heist begins with Lester drawing up two different plans of attack that are either quiet and efficient or loud and hectic. Each plan uses special drivers and gunmen that can be unlocked by completing random events and main story missions. Choosing which drivers and gunmen to use during heists can get tricky because more skilled assistants take more money. Cheaper assistants are available, but they have less skill. A less-effective hacker might not disable an alarm for enough time, or a poor driver might wreck during the escape and lose 1/3 of the money. Once the plan is chosen, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor need to go prepare for the rest of the heist by stealing specialty vehicles, obtaining keycards, and purchasing masks.These multi-part heists are made entertaining by the ability to switch between characters instantly by tapping down on the D-Pad. Long shootouts were so much better because I could switch to a character that had a better view or weapons depending on the moment. One such moment involved taking out a helicopter that had Michael and Franklin pinned down behind a concrete barrier. I simply switched to Trevor and shot the helicopter down with an RPG.Switching between characters also makes the open-world aspect of GTA V better. I normally played as Michael while running around Los Santos because he had more money and fancier cars, but I loved switching to Franklin and Trevor just to see what their opening scenario would be. Sometimes, Franklin would be taking his dog, Chop, for a walk, or he would be drinking at a strip club. Trevor’s scenarios were always the best because of how crazy they were. After completing a mission with Michael, I switched to Trevor just in time to see him throw a biker off a bridge. The best part is that this was one of Trevor’s more-relaxed scenarios. Another time, Trevor woke up on a beach in his underwear surrounded by dead Triad members. Little touches like the switching scenarios are what make Rockstar one of the best developers. Rockstar included so many details in GTA V that show their love for the series and creating a believable world. One such example is switching between radio stations while driving around. While I was switching stations on my controller Michael or the other characters would be leaning over and actually switching stations in the car. Additionally, the main characters were unable to switch radio stations while they were on the phone because their hands were full. One other example is the way that pedestrians obsess over taking photos of cars, scenery, or random objects with their cell phones to post on social media. I would constantly drive up to a restaurant in a fancy car and watch groups of pedestrians start taking photos of it.The cell phone does return in GTA V, but Rockstar added new functions that make it more than just a method of contact. Photos can now be uploaded to Rockstars social club web site immediately after they are taken. I used this function many times to prove that something insane had happened such as a cow being run over by a mountain bike. In-game phones also can be used for browsing web sites, purchasing vehicles, checking bank accounts, or assisting in missions. One Strangers and Freaks mission uses the phone to find multiple properties on a real estate web site that need to vandalized.The phone can also be used as a way to hang out with specific characters much like GTA IV; however, Rockstar changed the way that hanging out functions and affects the game. Characters like Roman would constantly call you during GTA IV, and if you didn’t answer or hang out with them immediately, the actual relationship would be negatively affected. Now, characters will only hang out with you if you make the call, which I highly recommend because some crazy conversations will take place. Each main character has a specific set of friends and one main companion, but some character crossover does occur. For example, Franklin can hang out with Michael’s stoner son after a few missions, or Trevor can hang out with Lamar after saving him from a bad drug deal. Mixing the main characters with the companions leads to some insane, but often hilarious conversations about cannibalism or being an Original Gangsta.Grand Theft Auto V is Rockstar’s most ambitious game to date, and it doesn’t disappoint. The heist-driven story plays out like a mixture of Ocean’s 11 and Fast Five with some A-Team sprinkled on top. Rockstar managed to take the always-successful Grand Theft Auto gameplay and mix in new features like random events and character switching to create their best game yet. I was wary about returning to another city from previous games, but Los Santos didn’t disappoint. Rockstar revitalized the main city from San Andreas but kept some of the most important locations like Grove Street resulting in a beautiful playground. Five years may have been a long time to wait for another Grand Theft Auto, but I am willing to deal with the time if the end result is always this fantastic.  ",

    "review_description": "Let’s be honest here, an entry in the Grand Theft Auto series needs no introduction. In fact, Rockstar could very well get away with simply announcing a new title and leaving the marketing down to its fans passing word of mouth. It’s a series that has worked hard to staple itself into the history of video games to become so gigantic that each new entry activates a switch within millions of fans, turning them into frenzied beings as they grasp air for the tiniest bit of news about the game before it launches.Everyone who plays Grand Theft Auto (GTA) has their favourite. To give you an idea about my background on GTA, I am a fan who thinks that San Andreas took the series in the right direction. I still enjoyed Vice City, which is often another popular pick, but San Andreas was the evolution of GTA III. It went with a bold move to remove the reigns from the player, allowing them to explore a vaster space that felt like it was hiding content in every corner. It was a huge and ambitions game, a game that was purely about having fun in its huge world. You can imagine my disappointed when Rockstar announced Grand Theft Auto IV and the series went with a more serious atmosphere, removing most of the features that were included in San Andreas and shrinking the game back down to its island format. Apart from the graphics, it felt like a step back, and I wasn’t a happy chap about that. Grand Theft Auto V remedies this, while also fixing issues the series had with its fourth major instalment.The narrative follows three characters with intersecting storylines that builds towards bringing the characters together to form a crew. This is a first for a series that has normally focused on one character, but evidence of Rockstar experiment with character roles could be seen with their standalone expansion packs, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony – along with some other mechanics that I’ll mention later – which starred new characters, but was set in the same Liberty City as GTA IV.Introduced first is Michael, a retired crook, who has left the world of bank robbing to live a new life in Rockford Hills, Los Santos, with his dysfunctional family. His old friend, Trevor, is seen here too, but it’s not till around five or six hours into the game that you are able to control him. Trevor is a nutcase fuelled by speed that causes him to become an uncontrollable, psychopathic maniac. He’s also home to the queasiest moment in the game. Sure, he’s twisted, but for me, this makes him the most exciting guy out of the three. Being in the mind of a person who would be regarded as unpleasant and “evil” in video games is rather an unknown territory, and I enjoyed that perspective. His unpredictability is a cause for many of the game’s amusing moments, as he knows no bounds with his recklessness. Lastly, there is Franklin, a younger dude, whose only experience with criminal life is gang wars and weed selling. Franklin’s current job is as a repo-man for a luxury car dealer, but that changes when Franklin is introduced to the bigger world of crime when he meets up with Michael and Trevor.Once the team is together, character switching can be done at any time, unless a story or mission blocks access to it. Holding down the D-pad and selecting a character with the right stick will zoom out the camera, wait a few seconds (for loading), and then the camera will zoom back in to a new location where the selected character is going about their daily business. These events seem to be random, with Franklin usually hanging in shops or driving around, while Trevor is frequently drunk as a skunk, waking up in some random place, such as a barn or on top of a mountain. Michael is the most “normal” of the three, as he continuously seems to be in his house, either with the family or watching TV.Each character comes with a special ability. Franklin can slow down time while driving vehicles to give him more mobility (think original Need for Speed: Most Wanted), Michael has bullet time, but without the awesome diving, and Trevor has resistance to bullets and increased damage with weapons. The most useful was certainly Franklin’s, as it helps with shaking off the police during car chases by activating the power at the last second to turn a corner, while the police are left to react late and miss the turn off. Police are easier to escape this time. Once you’re out of their search zone, each police car on the map is displayed with a visual zone, similar to the soliton radar in Metal Gear Solid. Stay out of their sight for a couple of minutes and you’ll be back to being incognito.Character switching allows Rockstar to do so much more with the story and gameplay. It’s not a feature that’s just in to add diversity to the playable cast, but allows Rockstar to give players a bigger scope to the overall story, along with allowing individualism to every character. If one person was doing all the events that happen in GTA V, then their characterisation would be destroyed. When the protagonists are doing their own thing, it’s dealing with their own problems, leaving the rest of the members out of the equation, unless help is required within the mission, then they are like brothers, coming in to back up their “homie” from whatever dangers they’ve gotten themselves into. It’s a fantastic way to change the flow of the game’s story, adding change to the plot, so that players aren’t clamped to following one storyline. I see this as a revision of the gang leader stories that you found in other GTA games. It allows Rockstar to build separate stories within an overall arcing plot. I always found it weird that one guy would work with all the other gang members in town, even though they all had distaste for each other. This never happens in GTA V.In fact, the story in GTA V comes across differently than other entries in the franchise. They are no major gangs, since your main adversaries are the police, FIB (Federal Investigation Bureau) or rich folk with the power to manipulate. GTA V emphasizes heists, building multiple missions around robbing banks or breaking into buildings to retrieve a target. It’s nice to see a storyline in GTA that doesn’t revolve around gang battles and drugs. Sure, those feature at points in the game, but this story is one that feels more upper-class for the series, no doubt inspired by crime movies.Speaking of heists, these missions are the showcase for the new and improved mechanics inGTA V. Each break-in is split into three sections. The first is the planning, which offers the player two choices – another new mechanic that modifies future mission structures based on what is selected – to tackle a heist, usually based on either a quiet or a loud approach. Most heists require the employment of additional men, which can be nominated from a small group, each with individual stats and costs that are taken from your overall heist total. After planning, you need to acquire the goods. One heist was to steal an item from a government building. This offered the choice of sneaking in as the emergency services or simply blasting your way in like mad men. I went with the quieter approach, which required the gang to steal a fire engine, find a getaway car and park it in a self-designated destination, and steal clothes from a janitor.Once the key items are gathered, you’re ready to go. Keeping on the topic of the same heist, it begins with Michael entering the building as a janitor and making his way up the floor he is supposed to clean. Michael has to look the role of a janitor; a little floor scrubbing is required, while at the same time the player is planting bombs in key locations around the building. Michael leaves after and waits outside. The player then switches to Franklin, who is the middle of driving towards the building in the stolen fire truck. Franklin picks up Michael and then drives off. The bombs go off, so the gang return as the impersonating fire crew and make their way up the building to steal the item. It’s not as easy as it sounds, as the shit hits the fan, thanks to the building collapsing and the FIB attacking, causing the crew are split up. Character switching is used to see the action from various perspectives as this is happening.You can guess the outcome; it leads to escaping in the getaway vehicle and avoiding the police. They are better examples for the character swapping, but those are key to the plot; I am avoiding spoilers as much as possible, but this should give you the idea that Rockstar is using the potential of multiple characters to tell a story with alternative viewpoints. At the same time, it also allows for varied gameplay. In one mission, you’re switching control between driving a submarine, flying a helicopter and sniping people, all within the same instance.Change is important to keeping anything interesting, and for me this is what was wrong withGTA IV. The game played it safe – it featured the same mission concepts, the same unlock system, etc. In other words, it was becoming stale, and Rockstar obviously recognized this enough to change things up. One major change is the world map. From the get go, you’re free to go around Los Santos and its surrounding desert and mountains as you see fit. This is the biggest map in the history of the series, and no bridge will block you and no police will attempt to kill you for exploring its vast lands. It’s a pleasure to be able to finish a mission by going for a drive and discovering the secrets hidden away. There are lots of random events scattered around, such as the hitch-hiker that I offered to give a lift home. She seemed nice at first, but it turns out she’s a woman with an issue with commitment, as she explains the story of murdering everyone she’s come into contact with.With 69 main story missions, GTA V is not short game, taking me around 35 hours to finish it with around 65% of the total game completed. You can easily spend time getting side tracked with the many activates. Want to play some golf or tennis? Then drive to your nearest one and indulge it some rather fun and robust sport mini-games. Into extreme sports? Go parachuting. Are you a fitness fanatic? Then take part in the triathlon and buff your stamina metre. There are side missions aplenty, with one quest group called “Strangers & Freaks” that include tasks as helping a journalist record a famous actress having sex, showing your friendliness by helping an old couple raid the bins of famous celebrities or taking on the challenge to be an extreme sportsman by jumping out of a plane and then racing down the biggest mountain on a mountain bike. The world of Los Santos is bizarre and full of content that you should never be bored with the choices on offer.I mentioned that Rockstar were testing mechanics in the standalone GTA IV stories. The scoring system from The Ballad of Gay Tony returns in GTA V. Every mission has challenges to meet that will result in either a bronze, silver or gold reward upon completing. Any mission can be replayed whenever you’re not taking part in an activity, giving unlimited time to master them and grab that shiny gold award. One feature that I am sure is to please is the inclusion of checkpoints in missions. This was introduced in The Lost and Damned, and it makes a very welcomed addition in GTA V. Some of these missions can be long, and I can’t even imagine the frustration that would happen if you had to restart from the very beginning. On a final note, you can now save anywhere, thanks to the use of the mobile phone, which plays an even more important role in GTA V, offering access to emails, texts and the internet, with plenty of spoof websites, such as “Lifeinvader” the game’s version of Facebook, accessible with the click of a button.The open world is packed with vehicles. Cars look like rip-offs of real life counter parts, with logos that spoof the manufacturer’s design, while boats, motorbikes, bicycles, and planes open up the choices in how you can explore Los Santos. As soon as you set foot in Los Santos, expensive and speedy cars are available to you that you hardly ever feel you have an incapable car. While this fits with the expensive and luxury setting of Los Santos, it also helps to keep dealing players with cars that are good enough – long gone is the feeling that “this car is crap.” The desire to hunt for the speed demons is no longer present. Modifications are present too, so you can turn one into a race machine if you believe it doesn’t look the part and park it into your garage collection. Land vehicle handling is much more improved. It feels lighter than before, more arcade-like, offering sharper control over your car that it’s possible to enjoy driving around the streets of Los Santos or participating in the many race events without having to fight against the game’s physics.A concern of mine was gunplay. GTA IV’s shooting was stiff, felt unnatural and very unfulfilling. Rockstar have fixed this, clearly using the experience they’ve had with crafting Max Payne 3, to deliver solid shooting mechanics. The strong auto-targeting of the 3D GTA games remains present, but, if you don’t appreciate its hand holding, you can switch it to a smaller auto-aiming system or a completely aimless system where it’s all down how good you can aim. People who have played Max Payne 3 will feel the similarities between that game and GTA V.There’s only one area where GTA V doesn’t feel improved – melee combat still feels archaic. Thankfully, you’re only ever forced to use it once, so melee is one thing you can completely forget about. It’s a shame that Rockstar haven’t learnt from Sleeping Dogs, because having good melee could make for some fantastic scenarios. Maybe that will be an area fixed in GTA VI, as that is the only thing to spoil the otherwise much mechanically improved gameplay inGTA V.On a technical level, I am surprised at how well the game looks. Rockstar mentioned that they were inexperienced with the hardware in the Xbox 360 and PS3 when developing GTA IV. It clearly shows when playing GTA V, because this game looks amazing. Open worlds often have to suffer with detail to make way for such a huge world, but somehow Rockstar has managed some technical wizardry to make GTA V look good on the eyes, while still keeping the game at a solid frame rate for most of the time. Loading times are kept to minimum – employing a huge load time when the game is booted that allows for the game to seamlessly transfer from gameplay to cutscene and back again in an uninterrupted instance. The only time you’ll have loading is when you’re restarting a mission or transitioning between characters, and even then it’s not that long, and as mentioned, you’re treated to a lovely bird’s eye view of the city while that’s in progress.Grand Theft Auto Online is an area of GTA V that is inaccessible at this current time. It’s due for a release on October 1st, which makes reviewing GTA V as a whole package impossible at this current time. It’s a shame, because the concept behind Online sounds fabulous. It might end up being an amazing addition to the game, or on the other hand it might be mediocre. Whatever the case is for Online, this review is only based on the single player portion.Grand Theft Auto V marks a refinement entry for the franchise. Not only does the game go back to the thrill and scope of San Andreas, but on a technical level, having the visual quality and solid frame-rate that is on display here is an accomplishment on such old hardware. On top of that, you have Rockstar improving nearly all the mechanics of the game to such a level that everything now feels solid enough to be able to stand on its own. The story is engaging, the world is full of wonder and the three protagonists add diversity to storytelling and gameplay. Perfect is such a strong word to define something, and while no game is ever perfect, there is no denying that Rockstar aimed in the right direction to perfect the formula that Grand Theft Auto original started with in 1997.Grand Theft Auto V is the best the series has ever been, and that’s a compliment that speaks volumes.",

    "review_description": "There is no doubt this game is superb. With a great story, characters, graphics, weapons, cars, things to do etc, it's a marvel. But it does has one major issue, an issue which has driven me mad. The police.The po-leese are a major part of the game. You will encounter them during missions, find resistance when driving off mission and they even appear in multiplayer. The problem is that the police, are just too good. People praised GTA 5 for making the police not know where you are instantly, which was something which irritated me in GTA 4. But that's bullshit for a start. They always know where you are and even if there is this illusion they are looking for you, they will come for you. As mentioned by people countless times, you could kill someone on a mountain top, with a silenced pistol and you will still get a star. To make matters worse, these policemen are super marksmen. I'm not talking pro, I'm talking godlike.Picture the scene, I'm holding up in a shop I've robbed, police outside. I start shooting at them, my stars rise. There is no way out, they are such a good shot, I will be dead before I reach the pavement. So I hold up and return fire. Or so I think. What actually happens is the police will come in the shop in single file and let me mow them down. It got to the point where officers were walking over 20+ still warm corpses of their fallen allies, right into my line of fire. But what they lack in common sense they more than make up for in shooting skill. If you pop out of cover for half a second to take a shot, I guarantee you they will get at least one hit on you. Sometimes it's a headshot, so you're dead.Even on the road they act without care for themselves or their colleagues. They will try to ram you off the road, which I'm sure doesn't happen if you have engaged in a fist fight with a pedestrian. Once the police heli gets involved you might as well turn off the game. The dead eyes and sure shots on the heli make light work of your soft flesh. The act of getting out of a car and running to another is made futile as by the time you have taken a step, the guy on the heli above you, quite a distance away, managed to \"snipe\" you with a rifle and take you out.The fun the thrill of the police has gone, instead you dread the stars, because if you hit 2 and you are cornered, you're fucked. All these issues are infuriating when you think they haven't learnt from GTA 4. In that game, the police knew exactly where you were, but they still weren't perfect and you could get to 5 stars and still drive around and live. Here, they fixed the always knowing police issue and replaced it with enforcers with god mode turned on. ",

    "review_description": " Rockstar is a company known for their creativity and independence. They’re not only independant in the sense that their publisher for the most part walks by the office only to slip a cash envelope under the door without interrupting the creative process, but they work independently from the industry as a whole. For the longest time this set Grand Theft Auto apart from the rest of the market. Fiercely original and uncompromising in it’s vision. While the Housers were once again able to achieve a very specific goal and a really good game along the way, this isolationist design philosophy has inevitably started to catch up with the franchise.Welcome to Los Santos, a beautiful re-creation of Los Angeles and the greater California region. In Grand Theft Auto V we leave the dreary faux New York behind, with it’s immigrants, biker gangs and night clubs, and are transported once again to the sunny west coast of Rockstars warped America. The story this time around centers around not one, but three separate characters trying to find happiness on the streets of Los Santos in their own unique ways - Michael, Franklin and Trevor. Michael, an aging crook that made it big and got out of the game is going through a midlife crisis trying to find meaning in his new sedate lifestyle while attempting to somehow reconnect with his spoiled kids and cheating wife. Franklin is the classic young hoodlum living a petty life of crime, trying to come up, escape the hood mentality that his friend Lamar is deeply entrenched in, and make something more of himself. Finally Trevor is.. a psychopath, strung out on meth and who knows what else, living out in the boonies conducting various “business” operations. One by one these character story arcs intersect and you start to explore Michaels past, Trevors present and Franklins future - all of which revolve around driving, flying, shooting, kidnapping and good old fashioned mayhem.Past and PresentWhile Rockstar dabbled with mixing up the formula in GTA IV by steering the story in new and not always satisfying directions, exploring what it means to be happy and generally presenting a protagonist that wanted to escape the life of crime rather than revel in it - GTA V returns to it’s roots with a classic take on getting rich and making it big. There are still some residual traces of this past approach to be found here - for instance Michael initially is hesitant to reenter organized crime in favor of leading a peaceful family life - but very quickly everyone gets onboard the crime train and never looks back. For the most part we play these games to have fun and let loose, and while in GTA IV Niko’s story was interesting considering how many people immigrate to the United States each year, his constant dour attitude and reluctance to engage in the chaos that the actual player is drawn towards, put a damper on the whole game. It’s a lot more enjoyable when your characters are motivated, able and more than willing to go wild, taking you along for the ride - and the new trio have no problems getting their hands dirty.Gameplay Mechanically this is a very similar title to what most people that have ever played an open world game are used to. You get in a vehicle, drive to a marker, watch a story cutscene and do a mission - right trigger gas, left trigger brake. Car handling has been greatly improved from the days of GTA IV where nearly all land vehicles felt like whales on ice. The physics now straddle a balanced line of arcadey to quasi realistic - meaning you can generally have fun but you still can’t hit the handbrake at 200 MPH and expect anything less than disaster. Gunplay has simultaneously evolved and taken a few steps back. For the most part aiming feels similar to Max Payne 3 allowing for more fluid targeting in the third person perspective - but the game defaults to an extremely aggressive auto-aim system that amounts to holding the left trigger and automatically cycling between bad guys at the flick of an analog. You can change this to completely free aim if you so desire, but personally I didn’t find the shooting engaging enough and left the auto targeting on. The city is huge and diverse, offering it's assortment of slums, residential housing, downtown highrise and a sprawling desert on the outskirts of town. Making a return are mod shops that let you customize your vehicle from new fenders to bullet proof tires, as well as purchasable properties that come with occasional missions of their own. All of this is very par for the course in the sense of what Grand Theft Auto is and has been for the past several years.One of the biggest new changes comes in the form of on-the-fly character switching. Once you’ve progressed the story far enough, you’ll be able to freely switch between the trio, prompting the camera to gradually zoom out above the city, pan over to where your selected protagonist is currently at, and zoom back in, showcasing a small scene pertinent to that character before you fully regain control. It’s a clever way to hide the load time and highlight each members personality - for instance Michael might be relaxing by his pool while Trevor might be dangling a Lost biker off a bridge. Each of our protagonists also receive a special bar that fills up over time and grants them unique abilities - Michael's straight out of Max Payne bullet time, Trevor's rage mode increasing damage dealt and decreasing damage taken, and Franklins unique driving ability that not only slows down time when in a vehicle but also allowing for some ridiculous maneuverability reducing even the tightest corner to a yawn at breakneck speeds. Then there are the heists. As the story unfolds, you will find yourself in need of money and there is one sure way for professional thieves to gain large amounts of it and quickly - and that is through carefully planned armed robbery. Pulling off these heists requires preparation, gear and a crew. You’ll have to scope out your mark, get whatever equipment is necessary to pull off the job - which can range from something as simple as carnival masks and jump suits, to military grade helicopters used to cargo lift entire train wagons right off the tracks - and finally decide who you’re going to take along with you which will greatly impact your final payout as professionals take a larger cut. You’ll even be able to choose from two completely different approaches for each mission, greatly differing in what you need to acquire and how the job actually plays out. Not only are these heists incredibly fun to prepare and pull off, but they net you a large sum of money which until the very end of the game is quite scarce. They also gradually build in intensity, keeping you waiting for when the big score finally rolls around. Considering this is probably the best “new thing” about GTA it’s a shame there are only a handful of these capers sprinkled throughout the quite lengthy story.For better and worse, Grand Theft Auto V feels like it was designed in a vacuum. Rockstar is completely unapologetic about carving out their own path, even if a better one has been stomped out by various other studios. Plenty of design decisions seemed to have been made with complete disregard for industry standards and what players come to accept as the “norm” these days. The mere fact that a lot of primary game interactions are triggered by the D-pad, something that the industry has long relegated as the auxiliary weapon switcher, is confusing at best. The lack of in-game GPS navigation the likes of which can be seen in Saints Row 3 means instead of taking in the beautiful world Rockstar has created, you’re stuck constantly glued to the oldschool GPS map in the lower left hand corner. Sleeping Dogs automatically slowed down time when you decided to shoot while driving in order to compensate for the lack of a third arm to execute this action properly. GTA V does nothing to innovate their own clunky system where you hold down a bumper until a reticle shows up and you instantly begin shooting, forcing you to waste a ton of ammo until you finally get a bead on your target. Mission design is still uninspired for the most part. Go to quest marker, get mission, go to another quest marker, kill everyone, outrun the cops. The new Strangers and Freaks missions that are sprinkled throughout the world and are unique to each character try to spice things up a bit by introducing you to some really colorful residents of Los Santos. Even then only a handful are fun and unique like having to kidnap a movie star for a deranged elderly couple, while the rest boil down to boring side jobs or monotonous collection quests. The core gameplay is still a ton of fun. Missions where all three characters are participating at the same time and allow you to switch between them freely are a novel experience - going from Michael wrecking havoc down on street level, to Trevor laying down cover fire from a helicopter above is really cool. The story is interesting with typically amazing Voice Acting. It’s just a shame there aren’t more of those missions, and when you’re thrust back into another boring fedex job you can’t escape the feeling that this is a little too “by the books” for a Rockstar game.Graphically the game shines. It’s hard to imagine that they managed to make this world somehow still work on 8 year old hardware, much less run at a more or less consistent framerate. Los Santos looks great. There were moments when I’d be driving in the desert with the sun rearing it’s head over the horizon, slowly warming the sky to a vivid purple, that would make you stop and gawk. Although the old hardware does rear it's ugly head over the horizon ever so often as well - driving extremely fast cars will drop your framerate as the game struggles to render all it’s detail at over 200 MPH. For the most part though, it’s a solid performance.The soundtrack is probably my favorite since Vice City but in this regard everyone’s mileage will vary. I was able to consistently find new favorite stations that I’d regularly keep coming back to. The talk-shows are probably the weakest they have ever been, but you can still find some good segments like the amazing Beyond Insemination talk show voiced by Danny McBride.GTA OnlineAlong the single player there is GTA Online that launched completely broken two weeks after the initial release of the game. Two months later the servers have stabilized but it remains a largely imbalanced experience. The mode allows you to create a custom monstrosity (the character generator allows for some truly hideous looking player characters) and dumps you into Los Santos with 15 other players. Therein you can do races, missions and various forms of deathmatch in order to earn money so you can buy vehicles and a house to store them in. Each race or mission is accessed from the overworld, but once you initiate them a lobby is formed and that mission splinters off into it’s own separate instance. Racing against other human beings in your own custom car can be a lot of fun especially if you leave traffic turned on. The recent inclusion of a Custom Mission Creator has brought about some really fun player made gauntlets with ramps and wackiness not usually seen in the more traditional Rockstar created events. The missions themselves are generally fairly straightforward, but the overly aggressive and pinpoint accurate AI combined with a ridiculously low shared respawn limit makes these a lot less enjoyable than they could be. Considering how much money Rockstar made from the sales of GTA V it’s strange to see just how aggressively geared towards micro transactions the entire game mode is. When in single player a single respray might cost you $1000 per color, in Online prices are bloated beyond belief, where some colors cost almost $20,000 each - almost twice as much as the highest paying mission. Matchmaking is broken or inadequate, seeing as very often you’ll find it extremely difficult to fill up an 8 person race lobby. The entire concept of grinding out missions and races in order to earn virtual money so that you can buy extremely expensive cars in a game called Grand Theft Auto is also very ironic. Still, if you can find 3 other friends to play with, there is a lot of fun to be had just by messing around or doing missions together. It’s certainly not perfect, but it’s constantly being tweaked and comes free of charge along with the already excellent single player experience. FinallyThe bottom line is that Grand Theft Auto V is a really great game. I had a ton of fun playing it, even if some of the missions were a bit more boring than others. The worlds that Rockstar create are so vibrant and full of character you tend to forget that what you’re doing is actually just driving from A to B, and get completely immersed in the details. Although if Grand theft Auto aims to remain the king of open world crime gaming, it’s going to need to start paying more attention to it’s contemporaries instead of rigidly sticking to their own ideas, which are increasingly becoming outdated.

    "review_description": " Pros: Fun characters. The huge attention to detail. The world itself. It's the little things the game does that makes it so good. Walking around, you get a sense that stuff is going down, that npc's are living their lives and your just part of the world. It's funny to hear people as they are talking on their cell phones. Some talk about their dick boyfriends,while others (mostly dudes) talk about their latest female conquest. I loved the fact that they brought vehicle customization back (I missed it in GTA 4). I can't speak for others, but for me, I love pimping out my ride and going out cruising, especially at night (everything is so shiny!). Shooting guns feels right (like a GTA game). If you don't laugh at least once in you play through, you have no soul. Like always, the music never disappoints (loved that they got Don Cheto into the game XD) The vehicle sounds are top notch. I found myself lowering the music sound sometimes just so that I can hear my engine hitting the last gearCons: Graphics are pretty, at times. I do experience lag, especially when driving around the city going 200 mph (never enough that your like OMG! 2 fps, maybe in the 20's range.). I'll mention SPOILER, not sure if it is one, but ill warn you just in case. I like the story and the missions were fun and varied, but I was a little disappointed with the ending. I felt it could have been a little more exciting, grand, huge, but it wasn't, for me at least.So to recap, its a super fun game. If you like GTA, if you like guns, if you like funny shit, you'll definitely have fun here. Beto out!",

    "review_description": "With a name like \"Grand Theft Auto 5\", how could you possibly live up to the expectations that the name brings? But if anyone could pull it off, it’s Rockstar. So did they? Well yes…for the most part. GTA 5 returns us to the sunny coasts, lush woods, and blazing deserts of the imaginary state of San Andreas. Only this time it’s present day and not the early 90’s. Also this time, players take control of three protagonists as opposed to the usual one: Michael, the ex-bank robber turned retired couch potato, Franklin, the promising upstart criminal stuck working petty jobs, and Trevor who falls somewhere between Johnny Knoxville and Charlie Manson. The three gentlemen play generally the same except for the differing starting stats of each character. These stats include driving, shooting, stealth, etc. and are a welcome returning mechanic first introduced in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and are increased as you play the game.If you’re like me, the Liberty City environment of GTA 4 just got a little stale after a while. That’s not to say that the city looked bad, it’s just there’s only so much you can do with the New York City motif to make it look interesting after 25+ hours. Fortunately GTA 5 provides a much more vibrant environment to look at with several different areas to play around in such as cities, forests, and deserts. It gives you the opportunity to see a lot more color variation rather than just the boring slate gray in Liberty City. This is all, of course, if you can get past my main complaint with the game: the graphical issues. Slow loading textures and pop-ins plagued my time with this game. Usually issues like this are forgivable if the gameplay is unaffected, but I experienced several instances where I would try drive through what I thought was an open gate only to hit an “invisible wall” because the gate just had not loaded in yet. And just watching the opening credits sequence is just plain ugly with all the texture pop ins. Now to be fair it sounds like not everyone was receiving the amount of issues that I was, possibly because I am playing on an Xbox 360 from 2007, but still. Issues of this magnitude are frankly unforgivable and it’s a shame how negatively it impacted my experience. The one graphically good thing I can say is that the character models and animations look fantastic.Now, that being said, the actual game part is pretty damn fun. Missions are varied and interesting, and every race mission is not mandatory to finishing the story, so there’s that. Gunplay is the best it’s ever been being very reminiscent of the gunplay from Max Payne 3 of last year. Speaking of past Rockstar titles, as you play GTA 5 you will definitely notice Rockstar reusing past mechanics. Random events a la Red Dead Redemption make an appearance (along with getting mauled by mountain lions) and even stealth and noise mechanics recognizable from Manhunt can be seen. Heists are a new introduction the series. These large scale missions make up the big set pieces you will see in the story and are definitely fun and exciting. The most interesting part about these missions is just the amount of variability they can have. You choose who’s going in with you, how it’s going to be done, and, depending on how you and your crew do, the amount of money you get away with.The story is fairly on par with past Rockstar titles though it falls a little flat towards the end. The voice acting on the other hand is incredibly well done and it really rounds out the story presentation. I’ve got 30+ hours of gameplay clocked and will say that it’s the most fun I’ve had with the GTA franchise yet. I’ll finish this by saying this: if you can wait for the mythical PC release, definitely wait. I can safely say that the PC will fix any of the graphical problems this game has and even make it look better. Seriously. Just wait.",

    "review_description": "Yes! This is now my favorite game of all time! Note that before playing this my all-time favorite was GTA San Andreas so there's some bias when it comes to me and the Grand Theft Auto series.This game is absolutely incredible. It does everything so good, including the little details.The driving was revamped. I would describe it's feel as a combination of GTA San Andreas' driving and GTA IV's driving. You can get so much speed and steel feel and be in control of your car without it looking oddly unrealistic. You can take down most fences. All this leading to a driving experience where you don't feel crashing is due to the unfairness of the game. Also, one of the protagonists' special ability is slowing down time and giving you extra turn precision while driving.Shooting is the expected cover-based lock-on stuff. Weapons are now customizable in both looks and performance. The most important change when it comes to shooting is the fact that you can now carry any weapon, including multiple weapons of the same type (eg.: you can carry both an AK-47 and an M4). Also the game slows down when switching weapons.Even walking around seems great in this game! There's always somebody doing something, people needing your help, cops chasing crooks around town. Random encounters are everywhere, I often set my waypoint someplace only to stop several times on the way there to interact with people. For example, this one guy was tied to a pole in his underwear after his bachelor party who needed to be driven home, and then to the church where you get to encounter his angry future-wife. You can even stumble upon characters from previous GTAs that could actually help you in story missions.The details are amazing. For example, every mayhem you cause is reported on the news, be it radio news or internet websites. Also, most characters have a Lifeinvader page (Rockstar's parody of Facebook) where you can see their friends, likes and posts. When it comes to friends, you'll never receive frequent calls being asked to go bowl, but you can always call friends to hang out (even 2 friends at a time). They'll always have an interesting new conversation based on what's been going on in the story until that point.Telling the story from the perspective of three protagonists that you can switch to whenever you please works incredibly well and is not at all as chaotic as it may sound.To conclude, this game is simply amazing! Play it!",

    "review_description": " In a modern day of games that are made in a hurry in an attempt to squeeze as much money out of a franchise, this is a pure example of a game that was created, nurtured and as a result enjoyed tremendously when released. Games like this don't come around all too often, the opportunities and activities offered by this game are as close to endless as you'll get in an open world game nowadays. it's one of the only games where you can really do anything you want to. Driving cars, flying aircrafts, shooting, robbing shops, are all part of the signature feel of what we know today to be grand theft auto games, but it's the amazing other things that Rockstar have added in to make the living world that is Los Santos a truly immersive world to be a part of. If I feel like flying an atomic blimp, going parachuting or climbing to the tallest mountain in Los Santos and then taking a selfie that I can later share with friends, I can do that, and that variety is one of the things that makes GTAV one of these games that you can play for hours and hours on end, without getting bored, and then still get withdrawal symptoms from if you don't get to play it for a few days. In the single player mode, you will be truly attached and locked on to the story that is being told through not one, but three main characters that each have their own distinct feel and characteristics, not to mention their own special abilities. MIchael, a retired armed robber has escaped his old life after a job went wayward, and one of his accomplices was shot and put in prison while he and the third accomplice, Trevor, escaped, not knowing that each other survived. While you play as Michael you'll have a more responsible and veteran like feel as you get back into the world of crime while trying to help a younger, less experienced character called Franklin, who is a brilliant driver and is taken under the wing of Michael. After finding each other after Michael and Franklin make a name for themselves, Trevor finds them, and soon enough you get to play as all three, sometimes in the same mission. While playing as Trevor, you'll reflect is slightly unstable character, whereas while playing with Franklin you'll drive and learn who to trust in the dog-eat-dog city that is Los Santos. The missions in the main story have been vastly improved since the last game, and finally checkpoints have been added to stop you from getting annoyed after doing the same drive to a cut scene 20 times if the mission is too difficult. These missions are also more various than in the last game, and there can be a real surprise when you play a mission and end up doing things you never thought you would be when you went in.And although this single player is amazing, its only one half of the amazing experience that this game is. New to the GTA line-up, is the new multiplayer mode. GTA Online is a marvelous addition to the game, giving you so much to do after you've finished the main story. you have the opportunity to build your custom character's whole life in this breathing and vibrant world Rockstar have created. Not only is this great for that, but it's also great to play with friends, and soon enough you'll be addicted, forcing yourself to make that extra thousand dollars so you can finally get that car you want. Although, the money making process can be extremely slow feeling sometimes, and you can get to the point where you could really use a fast way of making money like a mission that pays out really well, but most of those aren't really accessible until you rank up enough. However, we'll see if this is improved after the long-awaited heists are released for online. This game is a brilliant example of something that is pushing the game industry to new heights, proving that it is more than a form of entertainment, it is an art form, ready to be appreciated for what it is. This, in my opinion, is one of the best games of all time, and I really look forward to the improvements and enhancements that have been made for the new gen consoles seeing as one of the only problems with this game are the occasional frame rate dips due to the game pushing the PS3 and Xbox360 way past their limits. I highly recommend buying this game if you haven't already, like game of thrones, or breaking bad, it will swallow hours of your life, but you will love it and never regret spending those hours playing such a beautiful and enjoyable piece of art.",

    "review_description": "Last years champions, the St. Louis CardinalsAnother baseball season is upon us, and as usual, new baseball video games are ready to play, just before the opening pitch. MLB 2K series is back again, trying to perfect the system 2K Sports created nearly a decade ago. Sadly, it's this reason that this years game will be more of the same to most people, despite the good improvements in this update.Let's start with the biggest improvement in this years addition. Anyone who follows baseball, will remember the great pitching season Justin Verlander (the cover athlete) had last year. 2K sports tries to honor this by focusing on the pitching for this version of the game. The game adds a pitch tendency system. What this does is allow the AI batters to learn your pattern of pitches as the innings go by. If you continue to use the same type and location of pitches, the batters will capitalize on it. This combined with the ruthless pitching empire of last years game, make pitching very difficult. You have to constantly change pitches and location to keep batters guessing. This makes the pitching in this game the most realistic yet. The tendency system also works for batters. If you keep track of the pitches the AI opponent throws, you'll make solid contact with the ball; of course this is very difficult with aces like Verlander, Holiday, and Sabathia.The player modes are no different from the previous years. You still have a deep franchise mode that lets you do pretty much everything possible during the season of baseball. The My Player Mode is also more of the same. You choose the position you want to play, and build you character up, completing enough goals to make it to Coopers town. There is a new MLB Today interface with the game, but its more for show than anything.David Price, one of the aces you can controlThe graphics in MLB 2K12 is mostly the same, and that's this games biggest downfall. While they do try to fool you by adding more details to the players, like stronger noses, eyes, etc, the overall graphics is still the same from previous years. If you're looking for 2012 to be the year 2K Sports updates the graphics and presentation, you'll be disappointed.The sound, however, has been improved. Starting with the three commentator team. They added a lot of new lines of dialog. The new commentary is mostly centered around the pitching. Now, they'll update you on the types of pitches being thrown the most; which pitches get strikes and which ones get hit, and finally what the pitcher should do to either keep being successful, or to keep from being pulled early. The music has also been improved. Instead of just the predictable rock tracks like in previous years, 2K Sports added Hip Hop, Pop, and even Dubstep... yes Dubstep.Ultimately, MLB 2K12 doesn't do much to improve the series. The graphics aren't much different and the learning curve has been made even harder with the unforgiving pitching for beginners. If you're use to the series by now, maybe the update is worth it, but if you want easy to access baseball, you might want to look elsewhere.",

    "review_deck": "A Great All Around Baseball Experience",
    "review_description": "Reviews of sports games often times talk about the game modes and features that allow you to get more out of the simple sport that you are playing, and although I will touch on these things in my reviews of sports games, I think it is much more valuable to evaluate the gameplay and how it compares or reflects the real sport and also how it is as a fun and competitive game.As someone who has played every Madden for around ten years or so but either returned, traded, or sold the last five games within the first two or three weeks because of how horrible they have gotten, and as someone who dabbled with NBA Live and NBA 2K until playing NBA 2K exclusively around 2009 when the it became so much better than Live that EA decided to eventually change the name and then cancel it at the last moment in 2010, you might be surprised to know that MLB 2K12 is the first baseball game I have bought since the NES back when baseball games were, in my opinion, at the top of their game. I may not be an expert on what baseball games have been or should be, so hopefully if you have not played a baseball game recently you will know what to expect after reading this.The game modes you have come to expect from a 2K sports game are here just as they have been in previous years including Franchise and My Player, as well as the famous Perfect Game Challenge that has become a unique and interesting way for the company to generate sales without coming off as shady or cheap, but also incentivizing players to play the game in a certain way without the use of the achievement or trophy system. The Perfect Game Challenge, for those that do not know, is essentially a race to be the first one to pitch a perfect game (a game in which you record no walks, hits, or errors that allow a man to get on base) in order to win a million dollars. Having tried pitching a perfect game myself, I can tell you that it is not an easy task. Even my personal friend who has achieved the number one spot on the online leaderboards for both MLB 2K11 and 2K12 has yet to successfully pitch a perfect game within even the first week of release. Although the chances of anyone actually winning the million dollar prize is extremely slim, the Perfect Game Challenge represents the breadth of different ways this game turns the basic baseball experience into something unique enough to keep you playing for a long time.As I said earlier, the game modes are all well and great, but if the actual baseball that you are playing in those modes turns out to be dull, boring, or broken, than the amount of variety in modes means nothing. Though I cannot speak to the comparison between this game and the PS3 exclusive MLB The Show, I can tell you that MLB 2K12 represents actual baseball better than any of the NBA or NFL games represent their respective sports to date, and it even rivals something like EA's extremely successful FIFA franchise which I consider to be the best of the best in sports games these days. In order to get the baseball experience correctly into video game for there are four things that need to be done close to perfectly: hitting, pitching, fielding, and umping.First I'll focus on the pitching. Getting the action of pitching to translate to the actions taken on a controller seems like an almost impossible task, but 2K12 does this amazingly. A type of pitch is first selected with a button, and then aimed with the left stick. The pitch is then executed by motioning with the right stick in a way that makes you feel like you are truly throwing the pitch even though what you are actually doing is nothing like actually pitching a baseball. The timing is specific and hard to perfect, and the skill involved in pitching is rewarding but not frustrating. Any mistake I made when pitching felt like it was my fault for not executing how I should have. I am not an expert on theories or reasons for when and why one should pitch a certain pitch in real baseball, but after playing for a while I felt as though I was learning when it was a good idea to throw a strike or a ball, and even when I should throw a fastball or something tricky like a curveball. This part of baseball seems to be translated almost perfectly. That unique mental dance and flow between pitcher and hitter that die-hard baseball fans and players understand is here to be experienced. Even the wearing out of a pitcher over the course of a game, or the nerves getting to your guy on the mound after he gives up a few runs or hits in a row makes the entire pitching experience feel a little more like real life.Hitting and pitching need to work together simultaneously to provide a realistic experience that is not skewed in the favor of one or the other, and MLB 2K12 does this almost as well as you can. Hitting is fairly simply. Watch the pitch come in, decide if it is a pitch you want to hit, and then swing contact by pushing the right stick forward, or power by moving it back and then forward. On the surface that is pretty much it, and in reality there is not too much more to it than that, but hitting is by no means easy. In fact, I would say that hitting is the one the part of the game that takes the most work to get good at. When I started playing online I was getting beat pretty badly, but some of my losses came when my opponent only scored a run or two. This is because, like in real baseball, hitting is really damn hard. The pitch comes in so fast that is almost impossible to tell whether it is a hittable pitch when first starting out. This was really frustrating at first and it took some time to get used to, but my eyes eventually adjusted and learned how to accurately judge each pitch, and, like I said about learning when to throw certain pitches, I also learned when certain pitches would be thrown to me and how to play little \"mind games\" with the pitcher. Eventually, I would have games where I scored upwards of ten runs and really started enjoying myself a how lot more.How the game is called by the umpires is a vital part to the of the game as well. No matter the view you decide to take when pitching or hitting, (I prefer the same behind the plate view for pitching and hitting instead of the default behind the pitcher view for pitching) a strike zone for that specific hitter will be shown. This strikes zone is made of two boxes, one just slightly bigger than the other and the space in between representing what I would call the \"questionable/judgement call\" zone. When pitches land inside this small zone, the umpires decide whether or not to call them balls or strikes. When I first heard about this from a friend I was completely against it and thought it was ridiculous that even in a video game you will have to deal with shitty umpires, but it actually works out nicely and doesn't make you feel like you are getting robbed, at least not too often. If you are pitching mostly balls, the chances of a call going your way if the pitch is questionable is going to go down because the umpire is not going to give you the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, if you are pitching a lot of close balls and strikes, the chances of you getting an close call is greater. There are some times that this is not true of course, but the number of calls that side with each player usually works itself out to about even over the course of the game.Although most of the parts of MLB 2K12 are excellent, the fielding is one of those that can be great in spots, and disappointing in others. When the fielding works it's great. Movement of the players looks fantastic when they are diving for ground balls or turning double plays, and there is nothing more satisfying than diving for a ball in the outfield and catching it just before it falls to the earth. Problems arise when these semi-scripted movements do not work out like intended. For instance, there is a glitch (mainly when playing online that seems like a hiccup in the connection to the other player) that happens right after hitting a ground ball where the infielders do not react in time and the ball rolls right past their legs. This can get really frustrating, especially when it is a ball they should always field properly and it allows your opponent to score a run. There is also a basic scripting error that seems to happen on occasion when a batter swings on a third strike that hits the dirt. Naturally, the catcher picks up the ball and throws it to first base, but sometimes the catcher will clap his hand and glove together, like players do when they have a lot of time to throw the ball, and take such a long amount of time standing there with the ball that the runner will be safe at first. These odd glitches along with a weird steal exploit that lets your opponent get an automatic base hit from time to time, as well as the sometimes seemingly arbitrary player selection after the ball is hit that makes you start running in the opposite direction that the ball is hit, can make the fielding aspect of the game slightly annoying when things don't turn out your way.Even with the minor problems with fielding, MLB 2K12 still gets almost every aspect of baseball translated perfectly, even down to the play by play and color commentators that seem to have the most unique and varying dialogue that I have ever heard in a sports game. It was extremely rare to hear a repeat in dialogue, and it was usually because I had stuck with playing as the same team for a while. Most commentating during sports games are laughable at best, but with MLB 2K12 I never really noticed the commentators ironically because they were actually giving me good, interesting information that made me feel even more immersed in the baseball experience.There is barely anything negative I can say about MLB 2K12 as a complete package other than the occasional fielding glitch, and maybe the flawed leaderboard ranking system, and as a complete baseball experience there is no reason not to check out this game if you are into baseball. And maybe even if you're not.",

    "review_description": "I'm a bit of a music-game fanatic. Ever since I picked up Guitar Hero on the PS2, I've faithfully followed the genre through every single release. In fact, I'd estimate that over half my time playing video games is spent with rhythm games. So when I heard they were going to make GH6 the \"ultimate\" version, I was pretty pumped. While I can definitely say it is the ultimate version of Guitar Hero, it's also brings the least to the table.  Before I talk about the actual game, I want to talk about my purchasing experience. I picked up the guitar set, and while I find the new guitar perhaps the best they've ever made, I had to take back the set twice to get one that had a disc my 360 could read. So keep that in mind if you're looking to pick it up.  As for the game itself, as soon as I put it in, the Guitar Hero-ness was in my face. Everything you know and love (or hate) about the series is still here. In alot of ways, this game feels much more like Guitar Hero 3 than World Tour or 5, and that's not exactly a bad thing. It does feel like they put more of a focus back into guitar songs, and the storyline has a cheesy, campy fun to it. I will say this about the storyline though: there's something inherently off about a Guitar Hero game featuring a storyline about bringing back true rock. Didn't you guys make Band Hero, the game with Taylor Swift in it? Anyways.  Unfortunately, the game also brings back some sticking points that they seemed to be shying away from in the newer Guitar Hero's. The characters are the ugliest they've ever been. The graphics are polished as hell, sure, but man, those designs are just awful. And they get even worse in \"beast\" form. I'm still not sure what Johnny Napalm's transformation is supposed to be, but it will haunt my nightmares for a long, long time.  Also, the in-game advertising. It's getting out of hand. I can accept a few Coca-cola bottles on the floor, but when I'm watching a storyline about behemoths and mountains and shit, A GIANT COCA-COLA BILLBOARD kinda sticks out. And even worse, when you're picking characters, you'll see ads at the bottom of the screen, ala the Dashboard. And I don't mean shit like, \"here's the newest dlc!\" As I type this, there is an advertisement for JC Penny's teen clothing. Way to bring back rock, Guitar Hero.  All that aside, the gameplay is still solid as ever. They've done nothing to change the gameplay, and I mean nothing. Sure, there's the new \"perks\" type system for getting a jillion stars, but as for the notes coming down the chart? It's the same as it ever was. That's not exactly a bad thing, but with Rock Band 3 introducing keyboards, you gotta wonder how long GH can stay fresh, or if it even is anymore.  In terms of modes, they've basically split the core story mode into two halves: Quickplay+ and Quest. Quickplay+ is pretty much Guitar Hero 5 with everything unlocked: you have challenges in each song to complete, and getting more stars nets you more loot. Quest mode, on the other hand, harkens back to Guitar Hero 3: Each character has a set of songs, you get a certain number of stars to unlock their \"beast\", then you play an encore song. That's all well and good, but it feels like there should be more. Because you unlock just about everything through Quickplay+, there's not really a sense of \"Oh man, I have to complete this to get that unlockable\". The only thing you really get out of completing the quest mode are the \"beast\" versions to play as in Quickplay, and encore songs to play in Quickplay. I really wish they'd go back to World Tour's version of making money and spending said money on extras, but that's just a personal view. But now, the most important part of any rhythm game: the setlist. First of all, you can finally import Guitar Hero: Metallica into Warriors of Rock, and that's awesome. Seeing as how the game claims itself to be a reboot back to the days of guitar-as-the-main-instrument, it's nice to get some guitar-heavy tracks in there. Also cool is that the challenges I mention in Quickplay+ work with all your dlc. And finally, they've caught up to Rock Band 2 in terms of organizing and finding your music! Still not sure why it took them two years and about five iterations to do that.  Now, the songs themselves? Mostly solid, if lacking in consistency. Before the game's release, the developers constantly touted this as a game meant for guitar players, and as such, I've only played guitar. And for the most part, these are some solid guitar tracks. Still, there are some head-scratching selections. No one is denying that Bohemian Rhapsody is a classic, but guitar? Not so much. So you deal with the awkward idea of playing the piano part on guitar. Huh.  You also have to deal with songs that, while they may actually feature a guitar part, just aren't fun guitar-songs. Seven Nation Army? Great riff. Now play it over and over and over until the song ends. Nickelback? Besides the fact that it's NICKELBACK, the song is just boring. Graduate by Third Eye Blind? First of all it's Third Eye Blind, but that's the song you go with?  So I guess I've spent alot of this review harping on the game, but that's because there is some really great stuff there, it's just buried under the usual Guitar Hero-isms. I feel like this game caters to the hardcore, but even they don't get the full Guitar Hero experience they may have hoped for. All in all, it's a good game for most, and a great game for few, but it's not really perfect for anybody. And it will only be further scrutinized when Rock Band 3 comes out, provided Rock Band 3 keeps up the stellar track record Harmonix has.",

    "review_deck": "Warriors Of Rock: A Fitting End",
    "review_description": "Guitar Hero: Warriors Of Rock is the latest (and some say last) game in the guitar hero franchise, i quiescently a music/rhythm game where you have to match different coloured noted to the buttons on a guitar, pads if on the drums and pitch when on vocals (to be fair how you can not know this is beyond me as where have you been for the past 6 years)(?_?). Now back on topic... this is the best guitar hero game ever made... fact! (well my opinion really).The are new features include: Song Length Bar: the song length bar is a new part of the games HUD  it fills up while you are playing though a song the bar is split into 2 parts, it tells you 1 of 2 things,  when you half way and when you are nearing the end of a song (i like this feature because as i said earlier  it helps to strategic the deployment of star power). Quickplay+: This is a new feature  (well its more of an update) is an improved & reworked version of the classic Quickplay mode, it allows players to quickly choose songs from Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, as well as any DLC & imports that they have acquired. It will also incorporate the challenge feature from Guitar Hero 5's career mode, every song  (and any song you own through ether imports or DLC) and song challenges not found in quest mode. Each challenge features three possible completion levels - Gold, Platinum, and Diamond - Diamond being the hardest  (and most of the time requires you to play on expert). The types of challenge differ per song and instrument. I think that its cool to include this for ever song that you own but i have noticed that the song specific challenge are lock to the song from the games disc this is such a shame but i do know what a mammoth task this would be for Activision is they where to do this for all 643  (and counting)songs as DLC or imports in the guitar hero back catalogue, so you can see from their point of view why they would not bother with song specific challenges. Warriors powers: Warriors powers are powers/perks  (there are 8 in total, one for each rocker/warrior of rock) that change the gameplay slightly from changing to top end of the score multiplier from X4 to X6 or starpower generation to note-streak guards (there is even a power that will save you if you should fail out its called resurrection). To be frank i thought the powers are good but because i can play about 90% of the songs in the game without failing i really did find a use for them apart from resurrection (which i used only twice while playing though the games quest mode), apart from that all i can say on the warrior power is that is you a good and experienced guitar hero play the may feel gimmicky but for the novice guitar hero will find them a god send as they will help you get through the though difficult sections from songs as well as the really challenging latter of the setlist. Colour Swap: Colour Swap is a new optional extra  that will randomly changes the colours of the notes such as a green gem may turn up as orange, red or any other colour (the positions of the notes do not change just the colours), it is supposed to make the game ever harder (just like hyperspeed) but just like hyperspeed it depends on how good you are at guitar hero. I like this extra and i think is make the note carts look pretty, the only time it has thrown me off is when I'm playing a song with long single note sustains an example of this is \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" on Bass. FaceBook/Twitter Intergration: this is a feature that is becomeing common in game to day and guitar hero: warriors of rock joins the fold buy letting you post you scores and in game achevements ether via tweets for example  \"insert twitter name here \"rocked “Bohemian Rhapsody” on Expert Guitar in Quickplay Score: 283,638  #GHWOR (on Twitter) or wall posts,( on FaceBook, an example of a GH wall post is below )Quest mode is a new version of career mode: where you must transform 8 of the guitar hero rocks in to there warrior alter-egos buy collecting enough stars  (each warrior of rock have there own unique power which is unique to them such as Johnny Napalm has the Speed Freak power, this allow to keep they score multiplier at X2). It's hard to believe but the quest mode has a  story where the warriors of rock must be gather where they must them find the Legendary Guitar That belongs to the Demi-God Of Rock (the games narrator who is voiced by Kiss bassist and front man: Gene Simmons) in-order to defeat the Best and resurrect the Demi-God (i don't really care for the story but it a good story just not fantastic one). the quest is split in to 11 section (8: one for each warrior, 1 for 2112, 1 for the battle against the beast and a secrete final section for the demi-god which contains the game must brutal and hardest songs, those songs on expert will literary shred your finger trust me it happened to me).This  isa music/rhythm game so of coures i have to talk about the game's huge setlist, it's the biggest one there has ever been in a guitar hero game on disc you will get 93 song from different genres of Rock & Metal you will not find no pop music hear the closets you Will get to pop rock is the 2 Emo songs from My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". the songs in the setlist have been chosen to fit the hardcore plays taste by giving them fast past songs with insane guitar solos. i think the the setlist does what it is meant to...for about 55% of the time as most of the songs i were are breeze to pass on expert with no problem but then i came cross the death/speed etal song which totally killed my fingers but i only failed out twice so i did not do to bad. the only other things that i think i can complain about is the grouping of the setlist in Quest Mode as the way some of them are suppose b to be grouped into genres inorder to fit the persona of the rocker they represent is a bit off , for example Pandora is the game Gothic rocker and in her group  you would think she has Gothic rock and metal songs ...but no she has modern rock, alternative rock, emo & heavy metal (does that make any sense to you, well to me i does not), another incident with this is with the alternative/emo rocker Judy Nails in her set list grouping she is suppose to have alternative rock & Emo but wait she has songs from the classic rock & hard rock genres... yes she has alternative but what is she doing having the sons \"how you remind me\" & \" Bohemian rhapsody\" in her setlist hmm ? Now back on a lighter note one last thing about the setlist i like is the 23 minutes epic Rush song \"2112\" (it is broken into 7 parts with narration the the band members of Rush who explain the story of 2112), i felt that it's perfect and beacuse it's split up it gives you a few seconds to rest during the narration sections, 2112 was chosen for the game because it fits the part of the story where the 1st 4 warriors of rock find the demi-god's guitar,i like the way it just slots into the games story nicely.the prsentation is the best of any music reythem game every as the heavily influence brutal legend vibe fits nicely to this type of game the character models a look more realistic then ever and are well detailed (they ther are a few dynamic lighting and shadow issues, where the shadows on the character models jump around and don't flow smoothly but it hard to notice amount of the speeding notes that go down the highway), the mo-cap is the best yet, there are some song that have really good mo-cap as it fits the song quite well, the best mo-cap for a song goes to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen, some say they find it cheesy but i on the other hand found if hilarious & a fitting tribute to the famous music video i think they could of worked more of the camera angles for the operatic section but part from that cant complain. there and also great venues that are moddeled after the 8 warriors of rock and they give great visuals when the rocks transform in to their warriors alter egos.there are some of the mixes for some of the songs sound totally different from the original mix an example of this is the Fall Out Boy song \"dance, dance\", this song is my all time favorite song , so to see that they change the mix of the song to make it sound bands friendly, this really hacks me off  (in the original mix the drums and really domiante but in the GH mix the drum sound very weak) it seems that the do this alot with pop punk and Emo sosng, I know why they do it but why cant they just leave  them be? There are also some songs like \"Paranoid (live)\" Ozzy Osbourne's vocals (in paranoid live version) are way off the original song (yes  know its a live recording but i have heard ozzy sing and he can match the same key as the original)& \"Bad Brains \" (the songs just is a terrible songs)they are just terrible sounding songs. the only other think i hated is that the online did not work on the UK release date of \"28th September the online was broken (until the 28th when it way released in th US) even when it was working absolutely no one was online this is not help full when trying to get the competitive achievements), these are the only things that i can think i need to complain about.To finish my review Will list the good and bad points:The Good Points: Quest Mode: as its truly  epic and  a welcome change to the stardard guitar hero carrer mode. Warrior The Massive 93 song setlsit, i like around 97% of the songs that are in the setlist and they come from diffrent sugrenres of roc and metal so it makes me happy (^_^). The Presentation, theyavery detailed and very well put together. The New Features, i like hhe new features: the facebook and twiter ingtergration give new bragging terotry were as the a colour swap makes the note charts look pritty and im used to playing the game so it make it hard to put me off hasnto though me off. The Insane Diffculty, while mot of the song are easy for me to paly on expert the latter of which tiers killed my fingers...which i loved. Quickplay+, i like this because it update the classic quick play with the challenge feature, which lgeths the game by a huge amount  (this is dependant on skill,  instrument  and number of players). Warrior Of Rock Transformations: i like how over the top the transformations and they at eat use most of the stage up and are wuite elaborateThe Middle Ground (things that are there but i dont cear about) The Quest Mode Plot: i just think it serves its pouprose but its nothing special and that has not been told before The Bad Points: A small percentage of the song from the 93 setlist The online not working from day 1 0f the UK release date) The mixing of some song from the setlist, they make the songs sound weak.",

    "review_deck": "A Hardcore Look at Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock",
    "review_description": " This is a hardcore look at the recently released Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, a lot of this stuff may sound nitpicky but for the hardcore community I think they are very important.  Just as most reviews you'll find for this game is geared towards the common gaming populace, this is geared towards the hardcore rhythm gaming populace. About My ExperienceInstruments: Guitar/DrumsDifficulty: Expert/Expert+Game Pedigree: GH1-5, GH:M, GH:SHGuitar Hero: Warriors of Rock goes far out of its way to please the hardcore, but I  think it falls short of its goal more often than not.  The game peaks in a glorious barrage of hand-cramping solos that is bound to leave a smile on the face of any hardcore rhythm gamer, but these peaks are few and far between.  The setlist screams out to the hardcore, but at times I'm left wondering if that's the only part truly geared to us.  At best, I'd say Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock suffers from a bit of an identity crisis.   Warriors of Rock's primary mode of play, Quest Mode, has a lot of ambition but never realizes its full potential.  The mode leads the gamer through a series of sets and encores, akin to the old days of Guitar Hero 1 through 3, and reintroduces them to the characters of Guitar Hero and their newfound powers as they progress.  It's an interesting change to the formula that does manage to breath some new life into the gameplay, but there are some odd side effects.Some of the Quest powers and transformations wind up feeling really fun or looking really cool, but lead to a major problem: Quest mode has no score tracking.  I imagine this is a result of a few of the powers that would greatly alter the scoring structure, such as making Star Power completely fill up after picking up a single SP phrase or even changing the standard 4x multiplier to a 5x/6x multiplier.  Without score tracking, my desire to play quest is significantly hindered since nothing I do there will upload to a real leaderboard or compare with my friends at all.  If I FC a song in Quest I have little to show for it besides a 100% screen that will vanish unless I mark it down.  All my progress in Quest mode only leads to unlocking the final tier songs in Quickplay+ and more progress in Quest mode itself.  The song selection for encores makes Warriors of Rock's setlist feel weaker than it actually is.  In a game so focused on the hard rock and metal image, it doesn't really make sense to have a character transform into some ultimate badass just to play Janes Addiction or Styx.  Often times, the songs that lead up to the encore are far heavier and more difficult than the ones the game presents you to finish the set with.  It feels like many of the optional songs, such Bohemian Rhapsody, Ravenous, Hard To See, or Sharp Dressed Man, would be far better choices as encores than what is in place.  The setlist, overall, is very strong for the hardcore community, but the encore choices make it feel a lot weaker than it actually is. Quickplay+ is the major mode Warriors of Rock has going for it.  It retains everything from GH5's quickplay mode, with a few more sorting options, and adds in the challenges that were present in GH5's career.  Every song you play in Quickplay+ has a pretty large number of challenges devoted to it, and completing them can be some of the most fun in the game, especially the power challenges that allow you to pick 2 powers to use for a play through.  Unfortunately, it's a bit hard to tell what each challenge is.  The only place you can check a song's challenges is right before you play it or add it to a setlist.  If you max out a new challenge but don't remember what the icon is for, you won't be able to tell what it was until you go back to the song select screen.  You also won't know what the threshold was until checking it directly.  The reward for doing challenges is more stars that will collect over time and unlock cheats, extras, artwork, new characters, and other rewards.  The major problem with this system, though, is that NONE of it ties into Quest mode.  After completing Quest I was still rank 1, 0 stars in Quickplay+ even though I'd played well over half the songs in the game.  This separation makes the game feel like it is trying to arbitrarily lengthen its value by forcing you to play songs multiple times to unlock everything.   I'm sure this sounds like I'm down on the game, and the truth of it is I kind of am.  Setlist aside, there's not a lot in Warriors of Rock that's well done, well thought out, or well implemented.  It all starts to feel tacked on or cobbled together after a while, and that's really unfortunate.  Parts of Quest such as the 2112 stage and the Final Battle setlist of Megadeth tracks are really a sight to behold for rhythm gamers, but that's a very small portion of a large mode that ultimately never justifies itself.  Quickplay+ is great evolution of the Quickplay we all know and love, but some cumbersome UI and lack of Quest integration drag that down as well.  GH:WoR has one of the best setlists the hardcore community has ever seen, but the rest of the game just isn't there.",

    "review_description": " It should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the Guitar Hero franchise for the last few years that the most recognizable franchise in music gaming has an identity crisis. Publisher Activision, developer Neversoft and even the series own fans do not know what the purpose of the long running music franchise is anymore. Is it an arcade game with a focus on blazing guitar parts? Is it a single player game with a strong single player component? Is it a full band game trying to appeal to a mass market public like its primary rival Rock Band? These are questions that the series needed to answer with its sixth core entry into the franchise, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. Unfortunately all the latest title does for the franchise is muddy the waters further for its loyal, albeit shrinking, fanbase.At its base level this game is just like its predecessors in the fact that colored gems (notes) stream down the screen and players are tasked with hitting the gems in the proper sequence using their arsenal of plastic instrument controllers. If you have played a Guitar Hero or Rock Band game in the last five years, you know how to play Warriors of Rock. This stagnant formula is both the appeal and the drawback of the genre. It is easy for new players to pick up and play but it is also the exact same gameplay mechanics that have been used since the series' inception.For the past two games the Guitar Hero franchise has languished while trying to compete with Harmonix's (co-creators of Guitar Hero) Rock Band series. It moved away from the strong guitar songs to more band centric set lists and in doing so lost a large chunk of its identity. It also moved away from the style, personality and presentation of the first few games in the series. Warriors of Rock is a return to form in a manner of speaking as the set list is very guitar focused and in at least some ways the classic style and personality has returned.The set list of a music game is one of the main selling points for the genre and Warriors of Rock shifts, somewhat, from the all encompassing approach of the last two entries to a more hard rock, guitar centric set list. Warriors of Rock includes Metallica, Megadeth, Muse, Def Leppard, Avenged Sevenfold, and a lot of other great rock acts. As with all music games, one's appreciation of the set list is going to come down purely to personal preferences and some are going to enjoy certain songs more than others.Characters like Judy Nails, Axel Steele, Johnny Napalm, Lars Umlaut, amongst others were creative and helped infuse the style and personality the series built its foundation on. While Warriors of Rock still allows for creation of a personalized avatar, the single player campaign focuses on the pre-created characters journeying on a quest to save the world of rock. At first glance quest mode may seem drastically different from previous Guitar Hero games, unfortunately it is all just a cosmetic look and the mode simply boils down to character oriented set lists.The big difference in quest mode from previous campaigns is that each of the characters has a special ability to help gain additional stars. For instance Johnny Napalm has a meter that rises as you maintain a certain multiplier and when it reaches the max a star is granted. Multiple stars can be earned this way but being as the objective is to always play the song as well as you can the special abilities seem somewhat unnecessary. These powers also pose a large problem during the end game as the on screen indicators get very cluttered with stars exploding out of all parts of the screen making it quite distracting to follow.The quest itself is pretty standard fare. Assemble a team of the best rockers and take on the giant evil threatening the land. As the team is assembled each character must undergo a transformation to their true warrior form. This essentially doubles the effects of the special abilities and grants each character a new monstrous skin. Playing through the quest I could not help but think that the idea for quest mode was inspired by Brutal Legend, possibly even being inspired by the fabled guitar controller parts that were left out of that title after Activision decided to not publish it. The gameplay of the quest is very much traditional Guitar Hero but the aesthetics of it all are very reminiscent of Brutal Legend.Regardless of where the idea for Quest Mode came from, it does not do anything to reinvigorate the franchise and feels extraordinarily aimless. The campaign songs are all locked until their completion in Quest Mode including the entirety of 2112 by Rush, a major selling point of this game for some people. The presentation of the song seems somewhat random as some players seem to have a set list based on their rocker theme whereas others just seem all over the place. While Neversoft should be applauded for attempting to make a strong single player component, it is very hard to do so when the core games have basically become extra large track packs with a couple new features added in for good measure.The single player campaign is not the only mode to get a makeover though. Quick Play was hit with a complete overhaul of the traditional pick a song and play it system. Obviously pick and play can still be done but Warriors of Rock's Quick Play + incorporates the challenge system first seen in Guitar Hero 5 presenting players with an added layer of depth to the usually simple mode. Every song in the library, including DLC and exported disc based songs from previous games, has a bevy of challenges for all four instruments as well as for multiplayer bands. Adding to the draw of the challenges is the new Hero Feed which tracks the progress of friends giving you the opportunity to top their highest score.Cooperative play has been a strong focus of the Guitar Hero games for the last few years and that doesn't change with Warriors of Rock. Only have two microphones, a drum kit and a guitar? Warriors of Rock accommodates that with no problem, in fact any combination of instruments is workable. This can present some goofy multiplayer moments but it also does not exclude anyone from playing, provided there is at least some combination of four instruments. While cooperative play retains its strong focus, competitive multiplayer is relegated to a bullet point. The classic competitive modes all return but there just seems to be something missing on the competitive side of things.From a technical standpoint Warriors of Rock is arguably the best looking Guitar Hero game to date. Character models are crisp and clean while the note highway really pops. The only real complaint about it visually is that the venues just don't seem to fit the over-the-top style and presentation of the rest of the game. And as would be expected, Warriors of Rock is a great sounding game.It is hard to look at Warriors of Rock and feel that it is an evolution of the genre because it is essentially the same game that people have been playing for six years now, just with new songs. It is a good game but the franchise is stuck in neutral and sadly no one seems to know the direction the series should move in. It is a sad state of affairs but unless a plan of action can be formulated Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock may be the last big battle for fans. ",

    "review_description": "By - Richard J.Over the past few years, the Guitar Hero series has been on an increasingly devastating spiral down. After hitting its hayday in 2006 and Harmonix leaving in 2007, the series seems to have gotten worse and worse. Personally, I was always a huge fan of the Guitar Hero games. I loved the challenge they brought opposed to their competitor Rock Band. It's easy to see that the series was self-destructing, but I was holding out hope for this new entry. Does Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock reinvigorate my love for the series, or having me say goodbye to a series I loved?For this new entry in the series, Neversoft wanted to reshape and rebuild the stagnant series. The first step in their attempt to rebuild the series is adding in a narrative. In the months leading up to Warriors of Rock's release, Activision tried to sell the game based on this feature. Unfortunately, this feature is horribly implemented and not a must buy feature. The over arching story is about a group of eight rockers coming together to topple the demigod of rock. Through playing set lists, each of the eight rockers turn into their \"ultimate\" forms and come together to save the Demigod of Rock from a mechanized character called \"The Beast\". What ruins the story is how boring it is. Each character has about 30 seconds of CG showing them approaching the stage they play on. After the set list, there is another CG video that shows off their transformations. Throughout the story mode there are a few more cutscenes, but nothing that left an impact on me.Now most of you are probably thinking: \"A bad story, no problem. Guitar Hero is all about the gameplay; Guitar Hero is all about the rock!\" Once again though, Neversoft misses the mark. The base gameplay of pushing coloured buttons to corresponding notes on the screen is still there, but hasn't reached a proper evolution. Neversoft has attempted to evolve the gameplay by adding more notes and special abilities, but it all falls short.The increase in notes and special abilities are an attempt to reach the hardcore audience and make the game harder. However it does the contrary, and instead makes most of the game much easier. The increase in notes but decrease in difficulty create an ego boosting effect for those who are deep in Guitar Hero. The power-ups available are each character specific. Some examples of them are protection to prevent from losing streaks, increased star power, and the ability to come back after failing. After relying on power ups and special abilities, I have found it hard to play a previous Guitar Hero game.Probably the worst part of the gameplay in Warriors of Rock is the uninspired and uneven setlist mechanic in the single-player Quest Mode. Every Guitar Hero game has certain setlist tiers to guide players throught the story mode, each setlist tier increasing in difficulty as they go on. In Warrior's of Rock, the setlists are not organized by difficulty, but by genre. This makes for setlist tiers that can be boring to certain players and full of music they don't like. It also leads to uneven difficulty. Every other setlist includes one song that is at a much higher difficulty than the rest of the songs. Overall this seems like a simple mistake that Neversoft made, but has such a huge impact on the game. This mistake is balanced a bit by the ability to instantly change your difficulty level while playing. No longer do players have to have a different career save if they want to play on a higher or lower difficulty. The ability to switch at any time may seem like something that is small, but can have a huge impact on someone who is uncertain about what level they should be playing the Quest Mode on.Warriors of Rock also has Quick Play modes, online modes, and the song creation studio, but none of those features are worth going in depth into here. All of these modes have just been copied from previous Guitar Hero games with a few additions here and there. The game has an impressive amount of modes and stuff to do, but keep in mind that most of it isn't new to the series. This gives Warriors of Rock a cumulative feeling that makes me think that this may be one of the last, if not the last traditional Guitar Hero game we see.Graphics wise, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is a slight upgrade from the previous games. Just like Guitar Hero: World Tour and Guitar Hero 5 the environments in the game are restricted to the stage. This time around some of the stages are in some interesting locations, but are nothing to write home about. Certain CG cutscenes have some impressive graphics for the series, but they still do not compete with the rest of the games being released. Unfortunately, the character models don't change my opinion on the graphics. While Neversoft has finally gotten the character models properly proportioned, the upgraded characters look terrible. The character designs seem like Neversoft had some cool ideas, but ended up coming way to short when trying to make it appeal to a younger audience. For instance, one of the female characters rips her skin off to transform. She transforms into a snake which is cool, but looks so much like a cartoon that it completely removes the dark and brutal feel of the game. It's a shame that Neversoft didn't get these character models right because you can see they had such great ideas, but once again misstepped when trying to implement these great ideas.From the beginning, there was one important area that Warriors of Rock needed to rule. That area is the sound department, and ultimately, Warriors of Rock does a pretty good job with audio. To start, Warriors of Rock has an okay soundtrack. The soundtrack appeals to the typical metal head Guitar Hero player, but has a few other songs thrown in for others. Personally I'm not a huge fan of the music, but I recognize that Neversoft knows their audience and is catering directly to them. What isn't good about the soundtrack is the inclusion of a few questionable songs. In every addition to the series, it seems that more and more \"fluff tracks\" are added in order to snatch a few unknowing gamers and have them playing a game they won't like. Warriors of Rock features \"Bleed it Out\" by Linkin Park, \"Dance, Dance\" by Fallout Boy and \"How you Remind Me\" by Nickelback. These songs stand out as sores in their respective setlists and do more harm on most gamers' opinion of the game than good.Each of these songs continue to have the great audio quality that the Guitar Hero series is known for. Most of the songs sound like they are master recordings, and the live performances are also of great quality. Unfortunately, the big increase in notes makes the guitar drown out the sound of the quality audio. Unless you are playing a few feet away from the TV and have the sound up really high, you will end up hearing the clacking of the guitar more than the songs you are playing. All of the game's Quest Mode is narrated by Gene Simmons. Simmons has a great performance, but it is easy to see how over-the-top it is. While Simmons performance may be great, the lines he is given to read are absolutely terrible. Full of terrible puns, cliches, and immature jokes, the narration is hilariously bad. Thankfully, these lines aren't plentiful in the Quest Mode. I wish Simmons was given much better lines as his performance could have had a much bigger impact on how good the Quest Mode is.Another bright spot for Warriors of Rock is the huge amount of replay value. Once players are done with the six to eight hour Quest Mode, there are a plethora of other game modes which I have touched upon earlier. The huge setlist can be played locally with the guitar, bass, drums and vocals, and it can also be played online. The song creation tool and the \"Jamming\" tools can also suck up a bunch of time. While most of these modes may be recycled from the other Guitar Hero games, they can still take up hours of time, while also remaining fun.Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is the ultimate misstep in the Guitar Hero series. Neversoft had a bunch of good ideas, but they all fell apart in execution. The prospect of an epic narrative in the Guitar Hero series was interesting, but it ended up being a mess. The increase in notes and the addition of special abilities in the gameplay may appeal to the hardcore fans, but end up ruining the game for everyone else. On a better note, the audio is fantastic and the game has a ton of replay value. Warriors of Rock is a game that feels good when you first start playing, but ends up falling flat on its face when you are done with it. I can only recommend this game to the most hardcore players of the series. All other music game fans are much better off skipping Warriors of Rock and holding out hope that Neversoft can turn this dieing series around.PROSGood ideas despite poor executionFantastic audioImproved graphicsGreat replay valueCONSPoor narrativeUninspired and boring gameplayFun has been completely removed from the classic gameplayAwful character designsRating:6.25/10",

    "review_description": "For those of you regular readers you’ll know that I’ve always favoured the Rock  Band series of games. I love the sheer magnitude of DLC and the general band  togetherness has always been much better. In recent months the Rock Band DLC has  taken a spiral nose dive, much to my displeasure, when I noticed the new Guitar  Hero game. Having previously been grossly disappointed with Guitar Hero 5,  especially after watching an interview with the obsequious twonk of a developer  who was getting excited about playing keyboard parts on the guitar, I never  thought I’d go back to the Guitar Hero series for the foreseeable future. But  then this came out and I changed my mind. Allow me to elaborate. The tracklist from a first glance is good. Yeah sure there’s the obligatory  boring tracks which don’t work from dull monotonous bands like Silverskin  Pickups and Interpol, but in general the songs on the game are very good. This  is what the guitar hero/rock band games are about, rock music! They seem to have  cut down on the random spanish/french nonsense in favour of including more  mainstream metal acts which will appeal to the average disciple of Guitar Hero.  The songs range from stupidly easy to ridiculously hard and this adds depth to  their selection. The gameplay itself hasn’t changed too much but if anything is slightly more  polished. You do notice that on hard/expert levels Guitar Hero like to victimise  people who aren’t double jointed by constant combos involving swift chords on  the blue and orange buttons but I suppose this is manageable but my claims that  the rock band games are tabbed better still stands. It’s almost as if Neversoft  felt it necessary to provide too much of a challenge to some people because the  majority of the later songs on expert level are just impossible and I’d imagine  only 1% of players would manage to finish the song, let alone get a good score.  Plus the discrimination of the bass guitarist continues as they’ve left in the  buttonless open strum purple bar, which in all honesty makes no sense still.  Whereas Rock Band will reward the bass guitarist a 6x mulitplyer for good play,  guitar hero is still rooted at a maximum 4x and gives the extra note. Still has  no place. The quest mode however is redeeming and in all honesty is excellent. You go  through all the classic characters who’ve made appearances throughout the GH  series and can turn them into “warriors of rock”, hence the name. This almost  has an RPG feel about it and getting high scores on the songs will morph them  into awesome warriors with different powers which enhance your playing  experience. Powers include 6x multiplyers, double star powers and streak  protectors. Purists will argue that this makes harder songs more accessible to  weaker players but I think it was an excellent addition. Later on in the game  you can combine all the powers making grinding through all the songs very  rewarding and enjoyable. The only grind is that you’re expected to play through  all the songs TWICE in order to get 100% completion, but when you’re achievement  hunting, this is all worth is in the end. The party modes and Quickplay+, and competitive modes all return from GH5 and  this time make a welcome return making this iteration of Guitar Hero a great  party game. The character creation is slightly improved but can’t ignore the  fact that all the characters still look emaciated and gaunt, more akin to an  Aeon Flux animation rather than trying to make them look like people, but since  there’s more of an RPG approach, you can pass this off more like creating  chracters for Fable 2. The only hugedown side is the adding of content. While it doesn’t have the  DLC of rock band, it does have a large game library of which you can import the  songs. They make you put the code from the back of the previous game manuals in  as proof of purchase, but then ask you to part with money to download the songs.  But I’ve already bought GH:Metallica and GH:World Tour. Why should I PAY for  those songs on this game? I wanted to play the songs badly so I uploaded both  discs into my port of GH:WoR only to find half the songs (mostly the decent  songs) haven’t ported into the new game. So let me get this straight, I PAY for  the songs to be imported and half of them can’t copy? It’s a rip off but I only  noticed after I finished it. All in all GH:WoR is a very good game and it feels like Activision/Neversoft  are finally taking the competition from Rock Band seriously as you can tell from  the song selection screens and band bonuses. I do recommend this but I’m still  waiting for the release of Rock Band 3 later this month. http://synystergraves.com/games/reviews/x360/guitar-hero-warriors-of-rock/",

    "review_description": " On the surface Kingdom is a fun, enjoyable game but, a few key flaws in game design stop it from reaching its full potential.Kingdom is a 2-D strategy game that puts you in the roll of the king (or queen) of a strange land of monsters and forest people.You start the game on a horse riding though a forest. You quickly approach a campfire with some coins and 2 rather lost looking peasants but, money is power and after you drop a few coins they become more than happy to serve your highness.That’s how this entire game works actually, paying people. You start out with 1 builder and 1 archer (and you unlock farmers and knights after a few upgrades with the ability to hire more right away….. sort of. You have 4 stations at the center of your kingdom that let you create more workers. How do you get workers? Simple! Ride out into the forest and pay the random people who live there. Once payed they will walk back to your camp and collect either a hammer, bow, or hoe depending on what’s available; and there lies my first problem with this game: they walk.The movement speed in this game is awful for both your horse (which you never get off) and your kingdom’s people. Your horse has 2 speeds: walk and run. The only problem is the walk speed in this game is way too slow to be of any use so you always have to be running but, your horse can only run for so long before your horse gets tired and can only walk for a short time. You can speed up this cooldown by stopping completely and let your horse much on some grass but this burns up valuable day light.The people themselves will only walk everywhere which may seem fine at first but when it takes a new archer literally all day to get to a watch tower on the outskirts of the kingdom you run into a big problem. The monstersKingdom has a day/night cycle. During the day your farmers will head into the fields to farm and any free archers will hunt any animals they find around. All of this earns you coins and you can use to upgrade and expand your kingdom but in order to get these coins your have to ride by each unit one after another which gets very tedious.Once the sun goes down however it’s a different story. On each side of your kingdom there are 2 portals that will spit out monsters that will assault your kingdom all in order to get one thing; your crown. You have the ability to build watch towers, walls and catapults in order to defend your kingdom and any coins you may be carrying will soak up a few hits but if your crown gets knocked off and grabbed by a monster it’s game over. No crown, no kingdom.Remember earlier how I said everything walks slow in the game? There’s on exception to that: the monsters. The move super quick and unless you have walls up there won’t be any protection for you and your units. Once a monster hits a unit he will drop his tool and rush back to pick it up but, of he gets hit on his way back he’ll be knocked back to present status meaning you’ll have to pay him again to get him back in your ranks. The monsters are greedy too. If a worker drops his tool a monster can grab it and take off meaning, you’ll have to rebuy the tool as well. Worse of all, if a blood moon rises the number of monsters for that night with be much larger then the normal amount.The second problem I have with this game is the way is handles units. Once a person takes a job it is impossible for them to change it. I once got to a point where I had completely cleared one side of portals. What happens to all the archers in towers, farmers and knights on that side once all the monster portals are gone? Everyone just sits there, doing nothing. So I had gotten myself to a point where I never had enough men to attack the right side to they would get hit by monsters and lose their weapons and hammers then they would have to walk all the way back the center of the map, pick up a new tool then walk all the way back out but by that time it was night again and the cycle just repeated.If only the AI were better and things moved faster there would be a fantastic game here.",

    "review_description": "This game was like crack to me: I couldn't take distance from it eventhough I wanted to stop. I eventually did stop playing after I unlocked the last achievement, because by that point any player would have seen more than enough of this simple but suprisingly deep game.Kingdom is a sidescroller where your interactions are limited to the things you spent your money on: hire workers to build and upgrade, archers to kill, farmers to recieve more money. With the exception of one mount in New Lands, there is no other way to fend of the daily zombie-like army that attacks you every night (every 10 minutes in real time). The control scheme exists with a total of 4 buttons: left, right, shift (to run) and an interaction button. As you can imagine, you run a lot from left to right and back expanding your kingdom.First time players might find the limited construction options questionable, like the fact that you can't place walls, towers and farms anywhere you want unless it's located on a randomly, pre-defined spot respectively recognizable with dirt, a rock and a small stream of water. This means you can't always have a good constellation of towers and walls. Instead, you have to make a choice: Do you cut through the woods to find a better spot, risking your base to be neglected for a night or two, or do you stick with what you have right now?The simplicity has also a charm: the graphical design is calm and relaxing and the music and sounds go hand-in-hand with it. You mostly just run, time your attacks and think forward. Their are more mechanics going on than the developper will tell you about (in fact, they almost tell you nothing), which brings the satisfaction of discovery but also the frustration of trial-and-error with it. This is where most players seem to polarize.It looks and plays simple, but not without faults. You cannot decontruct buildings to prevent archers to run for it. You also cannot tell archers to defend the other side of the map. Specificly this will grind the gears of a lot of players, because all of them will reach the point where there is zero threat on one side of the base and want to put all force on the dangerous side of the map. The same goes with the archers in the towers: they won't ever leave it till they die. In these cases you'll feel like you have to power to fight, accompanied with with the feeling that you cannot use it. Experienced players would be able extend this list of faults, but will probably still like this game a lot.You should consider getting the mobile version of New Lands, since I found this game to be perfect to play while I'm listening or watching something else. The steam version can be windowed into ANY size, so you play it in the corner of the screen if you like.",

    "review_description": "Grow Home has a fairly basic objective: Grow the enormous star plant, ride its shoots into floating rocks filled with glowy green mineral sustenance the plant can absorb, and continue to climb the beanstalk to its ultimate destination above the clouds. The QWOP-like controls are both frustrating and endearing, presenting its metallic hero B.U.D. (short for Botanical Utility Droid) as some sort of unsteady but determined little trouper, whose frequent knocks and unfortunate explosions are warmly (if condescendingly) remarked upon by its caretaker AI \"M.O.M.\". Climbing entirely consists of putting one hand above the over in a regular rhythm, using BUD's clamps to gain purchase on any type of terrain, and much of the game is spent slowly ascending the central plant while a peaceful harmonious beat plays endlessly in the background, punctuated every so often by the tell-tale hum of one of the game's hundred crystal collectibles.It'd be fair to leave at that, such is the simplicity of Grow Home. However, there's a lot going on under the hood of this deceptively simple game, and while it feels like a proof of concept tech demo to demonstrate a handful of innovations that could be carried over to a more elaborate video game, there's still plenty of content here to appreciate. Recall Treasure's PS2 game Stretch Panic/Freak Out: a brief \"boss rush\" style game built around a central grappling mechanic that ended up being a typically bizarre Treasure experience with a lot of merit despite its short runtime. Had such a game been made these days, when smaller prices and compact lengths are more the norm, I'd imagine it would've fared a lot better. Grow Home is that game: it was released in the right era to be appreciated for its brevity and for the handful of new ideas it explores just long enough to keep them from becoming stale or overly repetitive.One of those innovations is the star plant itself, beholden as it is to the whims of procedural generation. One of those aspects of game design that has continued to engage and enchant the more mechanically-minded developers, procedural generation is as close to controlled chaos as a game is willing to allow. A game cannot be entirely dedicated to procedural generation, to this chaos, because so much of a game needs boundaries and clear cut definitions for it to function at all. In certain circumstances, however, like the layout of a dungeon or the potential growth of a character (or, indeed, a plant), the unpredictability of procedural generation has an immense beneficial effect to personalizing one's game experience (as, true to its chaotic nature, no two sessions will ever be the same) as well as extending a game's longevity - not to mention reducing a lot of memory space by incorporating a single algorithm instead of reams of level design data. However, the trick has always been to find where best to apply such a force, as too much chaos and randomness can make a game feel rudderless and/or bereft of craft. Fortunately, Grow Home's plant is one such worthy vessel of this capricious tool, continuing to expand ever upwards in wildly varying ways. Each new spurt of growth produces a number of leaves (which work as a useful springboard when the standard climbing feels too ponderous) and shoots (which are necessary to reach the island masses) in random positions along their branches, creating new wrinkles if those shoots happen to be underneath the vine or too far from the islands to reach in one go.The game is entirely work. Whether you want to qualify that work as the menial labor this tiny robot must perform to achieve its mission, like a horticulturally-focused WALL-E, or the very real left-button/right-button carpal tunnel-inducing exertion required by the player whenever BUD must slowly climb up or around a rock or plant to reach their next target, the fact still remains that much of Grow Home is laborious. Sisyphean, sometimes. In spite of this, the game has such a gentle and peaceful aesthetic that this strenuous gameplay gives way to a Zen-like state of serenity. You work hard to maneuver yourself around a planetoid for a crystal, but the process doesn't ever seem that draining due to the calming visuals and audio. Maybe it's the ever-present (and rather discouraging) danger of falling off, or the vertiginous view as you get past the thousand vertical meters mark, but something about the climbing remains engaging, even if all you've done in the last ten minutes was to ascend to the next teleporter shortcut or moved about three shoots' worth of horizontal growth to reach a single floating rock. It's safe to say that, for as short as the game is, it feels as precisely as long as it needs to be. Or, perhaps, as long as it can get away with before it really does start to feel like a chore.Like its focal flora, the game continues to expand beyond its original parameters. A few days after its release, the game received an update which added a secondary mission that nonetheless greatly expanded the challenge and longevity of the game without having to add a whole lot of new assets. The player could now locate the various plantlife and animals that littered the floating environs and then ascertain a means to drag them to the nearest teleporter where they could be scanned by the MOM computer and added to a biological database. This in itself presents a lot of smaller challenges, such as coercing the obstinate \"meep\" creatures to the nearest teleporter, or emancipating a particularly uncompromising pineapple-like fruit from its palm tree. These challenges are, like the core game, a mix of frustration and endearing moxie and worth it for the \"King of All Cosmos\"-style descriptions given to them by your mercurial master AI.Grow Home has its problems, to the extent that its short runtime only works because if it were any longer the game would be almost unbearable. Despite this, there's a lot of satisfaction to be gleaned from the experience, and satisfaction isn't a particularly common positive feeling one derives from their games. It's an emotion reserved for those who choose to challenge themselves with high difficulty levels, or spend hours running around collecting Totally Arbitrary Collectible Objects for a full set. While Grow Home isn't anywhere near as time-consuming or arduous as those examples, there's a lot to be said for looking down occasionally just to see how far you've come. In that regard, it comes highly recommended.",

The fact that climbing is so satisfying keeps you interested in checking out the next sky island. Even after you get to the top it extends itself a little bit to give you a reason to search for something new. Plus this game doesn't overstay it's welcome since it is fairly short even if you do everything possible. This also means that it does not have very much replay value unless you like dropping B.U.D. into the ground a lot. Overall this is a unique and fun little game that should be experienced at least once. ",

    "review_description": "I was really expecting to like this game. I like inventive games and new ideas.  It's got a great style and premise, and it tries some new things, but in reality it's not a great experience. That wasn't to say I didn't like some things about the game.  What I did like was the art and the idea that the player has some agency in how the red flower shoots grow, changing the world somewhat in the process.  What I didn't like were the poor controls the mundane world, and the lack of an interesting story.  I played the PS4 version, and I was surprised to see many moments with frame rate issues, but it wasn't game-breaking.The game is partially a collectathon (collect 100 crystals, scan various objects found in the game), and partially a skydiving game. I found the world to be pretty in a way that reminds me of Proteus or Darwinia, but the tiny vertical world becomes mundane and uninteresting after a couple hours.  There just isn't that much to see, and what you do find is not interesting: familiar animals on an alien world, fruit, more fruit, mushrooms, and other plants.  I collected everything I could during the first half of the game, but I realized by then I was not actually having fun doing it.  The game became a chore.  The controls are infuriating, and the game expects the player to be nimble by the end. Controlling B.U.D. is a heavy-handed physics approach, where momentum isn't easy to handle. I learned to deal with most of it, but the running and climbing never felt anything but tedious and frustrating to me by the end.  There is a button for self-destructing B.U.D. and I used it a lot by the end because I was falling often and I wasn't going to wait 2 minutes for B.U.D. to die.  I found myself in many situations where I fell off a leaf or branch, and I recovered by landing on a lower branch, but it was easier to die than to go through the tedium of climbing back up.There was no great payoff by the end, like a fun story reveal about who you work for (besides M.O.M.), just some text and credits. Maybe more is revealed as you complete your object collections after the main game is over, but I'm not interested enough to suffer through that process.  I had a hard time wanting to finish this game, but I was overjoyed by the end only because my frustration and disappointment was finally over.",

Its whimsical nature encourages you to explore the game world at your own pace. And screwing up isn't the worst thing in the world. At most, you'll have to climb up to where you were before, which isn't bad, given that you're unlocking the teleporters. The physics based controls of B.U.D. (Botanical Utility Droid) will lead to some weird animation and movement, which means it's probably not for everybody.It took me under five hours to complete the main objective, but it gives you more to do afterwards if you're inclined to keep playing.

    "review_description": "Grow Home does not feel like a complete game. The pretty visuals and very nice sound effects are pasted on top of a thin game. In controlling a small explorer robot on an alien planet, you're tasked with awkwardly climbing around sparse, featureless environments in order to find dull collectibles which give you largely uninteresting movement and control upgrades in order to help you climb higher. There is no challenge to the game other than the awkward, momentum driven controls. You stumble your way from vine to vine of the large plant you are trying to \"grow\" by extending branches into easily visible energy sources again and again. It's easy, repetitive, slow and really quite tedious. Finding the 100 collectibles around the environment is a simple matter of following the hum of the crystals you're trying to find and walking towards it like looking for a cricket in a field. It's about as interesting as that. After you've completed the game, you're asked to go back and find some more, equally uninteresting collectibles. The presentation is nice, particularly the little verbalisations of your robot, but the game itself is overly shallow and straightforward in every aspect other than the one that would count, the game's controls. They fight against you for the entire game, short as it is. Though there is some satisfaction in overcoming them, this is hardly a design feature to be praised.",

    "review_description": "This is a nice, fun little game that I beat to my satisfaction within 3 hours of playing. In it you are a little robot man who is sent to an alien (but relatively familiar-looking) world and tasked with making a giant plant grow high enough to reach your spaceship, which is located at 2,000m above sea level. In order to make the body of the plant grow, you must climb onto the sprouts budding from it and guide them into floating islands filled with energy juice. Along the way are 100 crystals to find, and you get a new ability at roughly every 20 crystals collected.It's heavily physics-oriented. Every interaction with the environment, from climbing up walls to yanking crystals out of the ground is done by latching your hands onto things using the left and right triggers to control that respective hand. The robot moves realistically, which is to say clumsily. Moving on uneven surfaces can cause stumbling and steep slopes will cause him to tumble down. It sounds more frustrating than it actually is, since maneuvering is the primary challenge. To start out with you will mostly be climbing, which can be done on any surface. Eventually you get flowers which act as parachutes, leaves that act as hang-gliders, and a rocket pack for better mid-air control.What makes it work is the amount of freedom you have within the game's space. The plant's sprouts can be extended far out in any direction the player chooses. As the robot gets higher into the atmosphere and landmasses become less frequent, the player is more or less entirely building their own level within the game's blueprints. This freedom also extends to the goals. The stated goal is, of course, to 'grow home' back to your spaceship. But searching for all 100 crystals has you broadening the scope of your exploration in a way that is possibly more interesting. Furthermore, any vegetable and animal you discover can be dragged back to a fast travel point and analyzed by your ship's computer and placed into a database. Some of those plants and animals can be tricky to find and trickier to bring back to a teleporter. I could definitely see some players getting more enjoyment out of filling that database than anything else.I have a few complaints. The camera has two zoom levels, one of which is slightly too far away and the other is slightly too close. It's manageable but why settle for manageability when you can have a camera that's good? That and the climbing can sometimes be iffy in more extreme conditions. For example, climbing along the underside of a giant floating island. Just make sure to pay attention and make sure your left hand is definitely attached to a surface before letting go with your right hand.The world's quite nice overall. Even though it is small, there are a few different biomes. There are secret caves dotted along here and there, and plenty of optional islands floating in the sky. In a lot of ways it's tonally reminiscent of 'walking simulators' such as Proteus, Dear Esther, and Journey. You know, go around a pretty world and 'ooh aah' at the pretty stuff you find-- none of which has much of an impact on your ability to walk around and go 'ooh ahh'. Where I think Grow Home gets one over on those is in its inclusion of goals and in the player's ability to impact the environment in a way that comes back around and impacts the player. Instead of simply presenting a world to explore and expecting you to do so in good faith it gives you several good, but not punishing reasons to exist in the world and exhaust its secrets. And I liked doing it! Grow Home does what it intends to do very well.",

    "review_description": "I went into Grow Home looking for something a little more relaxed and simplified in subject matter than the story based game I played directly preceding it. I didn’t expect much from Grow Home, and all I knew was that it was a colorful game with a robot. What really blew me away about Grow Home - and I was blown away - was how delightful the whole game was.The climbing mechanic in Grow Home is simple but I haven’t seen it before in a game, in that when either of the triggers on the controller is pressed, that arm on B.U.D. (the player character) grabs hold of whatever the indicator icon hovers over. Once the trigger is released, B.U.D. lets go. This simple mechanic meant that climbing up massive plants and mountains feels far more tactile and engaging than in any game I’ve played previously. The entirety of Grow Home is based around this simple mechanic, the player climbs, guides the growth of new stalks, and climbs further up the central great Star Plant - a massive budding sunflower that B.U.D. must grow further until it opens its petals in orbit next to his spaceship. The game is only a few hours long and is very pure in that the entire experience revolves around the climbing and growing, but it never grew dull, as the mechanic is so fun, and the world and characters (B.U.D. receives instructions from the AI that sent him, M.O.M.) are vibrant and very cute.Grow Home was a joy to play and was the perfect length, its simplicity being a crucial part of its charm, I happily rate it with aScore: A-",

    "review_description": "i'll keep this short. grow home does a lot of unique things. the control scheme is unconventional but easily stands out as the takeaway from this game that makes it stand out from the rest of the crop. i love the aesthetic it develops. the low poly environments work well hand in hand when B.U.D and M.O.M are seemingly floating amalgamations of cubes and lighting effects. i understand the praise the game receives and would like to see more developers make entries in this style of game.here's where i take some issue.regardless of whether or not the design of the game was intentional in giving B.U.D floaty momentous controls in order to enhance the feeling of controlling a robot infant doesn't provide much comfort when you're trying to land after a couple thousand meter drop, hit a platform and roll off only to lose another few thousand feet and float back to the beginning of the game. checkpoints were designed for this purpose in the form of the teleportation pads, however, there are just enough to make it frustrating. if the team would have decided to add one or two more in the stratosphere, the game would be much more forgiving to people such as myself who don't play as many platformers as they feel they should. this is on top of some frustrating technical glitches i've experienced falling through vines and B.U.D disappearing in the middle of climbing after i've made some significant progress on the star vine.i know this sounds like i'm tearing this game apart but there are a lot of aspects that succeed in providing an entertaining albeit cathartic experience like i previously stated shortly at the beginning of my review. connecting vines to the glowing rocks floating on the edge of space provides a relaxing and atmospheric experience one can easily vibe out too. B.U.D's quirky chirps provide just enough characterization to project a personality onto, especially when paired with the supportive and optimistic lines provided from M.O.M.i'll close this out by saying platformers have never really been my bag. like one mr. austin walker, i respect the genre from a distance and have played and loved a few heavy hitters (super mario brothers 3, psychonauts) enough to understand their appeal. however, grow home just never clicked with me in the same way. on a larger scale, i'd give it a 6/10.",

    "review_description": "One of the first “toys” I could throw into my Little Inferno fire place was a credit card, an unsettling notion that didn’t exactly instill confidence in my purchase of Tomorrow Corporation's latest title. Touching the plastic to the heat quickly swallowed it in flames, and from these flames coins would spew that I’d then collect and spend on more toys. It’s pointless, but what’s both cruel and interesting about Little Inferno is that it knows its pointless, and yes, perhaps even a waste of money.Little Inferno would have you believe it's entirely without objectives, as your quirky neighbor Sugar Plumps reminds you in her letters describing the game’s aimlessness. In actuality, though, it’s really about matching, burning clever combinations of toys to meet a certain quota before advancing to new catalogs to order from. Descriptions of possible matches, like “Spring Time,” can be challenging, but in this case, simply hinting at the pairing of an alarm clock and flower.Once you get several catalogs deep, memory begins to play a key role as matches span across both the old and new. Protein supplements, galaxies, nuclear bombs and opera singers, there’s a lot of bizarre stuff to throw in the fire, and to keep track of for when new matches are unlocked. For example, to achieve the “Online Piracy” match, you’ll need to remember the toy pirate from the first catalog and pair it with the internet cloud you can purchase in the fifth.That sort of contemporary reference and charm is frequent in Little Inferno. There’s even several pertaining to other popular indie titles like a cardboard Super Meat Boy or the spider from Limbo, and item descriptions are often funny jabs at consumerist society. But if that’s what the experience is ultimately getting at, it feels too transparent to make its cultural criticisms powerful. If anything, the game and its ending feel a bit preachy.Not that the fireplace can’t be entertaining, where various items give off all sorts of disturbing and pleasing effects in the flame, but they soon die down and leave you with an empty feeling, which may very well be the point of the game. Creating brief pleasure and leaving you in the cold as you wait for your next shipments to arrive, packages taking up to several minutes to arrive towards the last catalog, perhaps allowing time for personal reflection.But at these times I found myself deviating from the game, minimizing to check facebook, using the bathroom, even brewing up a cup of tea as I waited for the last toy to arrive. The nature of the letters from Sugar Plumps and a weather man with constant forecasts of snow had made me anxious to see a meaningful finale -- with Kyle Gabler’s musical contributions being particularly foreboding -- but I was far past the enjoyments of the fire itself.And maybe that’s what it wanted, for me to realize how senseless it all was. But bored and with unquenched curiosity as well? Probably not.",

    "review_description": "World of Goo was an outstanding game that had an interesting subplot and a mixture of clever physic based puzzles and a charming atmosphere. If you go into Little Inferno thinking you are going to get the same experience you will be disappointed, Little Inferno is not that difficult and some people would question whether it is even a video game, but if you know what to expect going in then you will discover one of the most original games that you can get for your new Wii U system.As soon as you start you are put in front of the Little Inferno, the Little Inferno is a fireplace developed by the Tomorrow Corporation. You use it by putting toys into it and then setting them alight, once it has burnt up coins will come out of it. You use these coins to buy more toys in catalogs that you have, the new toys show up and then you burn them and the process repeats itself until the very end of the game.If what i said to you sounds repetitive and tedious, it is not. It is highly addicting in which the way it is set up. Each time you buy a toy in the catalog the next toy is unlocked and able to be purchased. So they are unlocked at a very fast rate and each toy will do a different thing when mixed with fire. Once you reach the end of a catalog you can't progress onto the next one until you have done enough combo's.There are 99 combo's in the game, the only clue you get is the name of the combo. The first one is called \"Bike Pirate\", to get that combo all you need is the toy pirate and the toy bike and then wallah, combo unlocked. They do get rather clever though and you'll fine great enjoyment in experimenting with the different toys to try and get a new combo.Each time you buy a toy there is waiting period, the cheaper the toy the quicker it arrives. Some of the more expensive ones will take minutes to arrive where as the cheap ones can take as long as 10 seconds. You want to really always be burning toys, the more toys you burn at the same time the more money you get. Every time you get a combo a few tickets will drop down as well as some coins, if you want to get a toy instantly instead of waiting for however long for it to arrive, you can pay a few tickets to get it to arrive. The game can be played either on the Gamepad or with a Wiimote, it works fine with both but I found myself playing with it more on the gamepad.Throughout the game you are sent letters from people in the outside world, aside from one dark but humorous advertisement for the Little Inferno this is how the plot is told. You get letters quite frequently and through the letters you surprisingly get attached to one particular sender. The game takes a dark turn towards the end and it really is an emotional moment. The game succeeds in it's humour, each toy has a little description and most of the time its very witty. The letters you receive are well done and on the whole are spot on and you will look forward to future letters.Then at the very end of the game everything is revealed and without spoiling the ending let me just say it is one of the best endings I have seen in a video game this year. The way the plot is told reminds me very much of Journey, slowly trickled out but never given too much information, always wanting more answers but instead get more questions.The game has a very charming sense of style, it's art style resembles that of World of Goo and a little bit of Rem and Stimpy/Tim Burton. I don't wish to spoil the ending, but I will say that you will appreciate how good the game looks at the end portion of the game. There isn't much music in the game, but the music that there is fits perfectly into what it is trying to represent.Some people may question the price vs length of Little Inferno, it's currently £12.99 and the game lasted about 4 hours which was me completing the game 100%. The end result I thought was worth the price of admission, those that question the price are the same people that questioned the price of Journey and Journey is one of the best games this year.For those people that don't see why people like games like Journey and Flower and think there a waste of money, you should not purchase Little Inferno. For those that are willing to take quality over quantity however I cannot recommend Little Inferno enough.",

    "review_description": "Calling Little Inferno a 'game' is difficult for me, as it's really more of a interactive toy than a proper game. That said, there is a win condition and a ending leading to the credits, but there is no lose condition, no way to reach a game over screen, which is drastically different in comparison to World of Goo, where failing a level means you outright fail and have to start at the beginning again. World of Goo was a actual game with a heart, emotion and a wonderful soundtrack, but Little Inferno fails to really bring the game aspect to the table, making it hard for me to recommend as a video game purchase for longevity, but easy for me to recommend as a cheap purchase if you want to experience an odd story of pyromania.Little Inferno has you becoming the 'proud' (large emphasis on those quotes, there) owner of the Little Inferno fireplace kit from Tomorrow Corporation, a fireplace that will incinerate anything put inside of it. Anything. From wooden blocks to squeaky toys to expired medication to miniature moons, you purchase items from catalogues supplied to you from the corporation which are mailed directly to you to toss into your fireplace to send up in a puff of smoke, leaving only ashes and coins behind. These coins always reward you with more money than the original purchase, and through this cycle you will burn more, unlock more, and eventually find out the 'secret' behind why you never tear yourself away from staring at the fireplace.Now, I could sit here and babble on to you about the psychological fascination with just tossing stuff into the fireplace, dragging your mouse around and watch it go ablaze, but really, there's only one major reason to complete Little Inferno; the WHY. World of Goo had you wondering why the goo balls made their treacherous pilgrimage around the world getting sucked up by giant vacuums, and Little Inferno will have you wondering why the world outside is slowly freezing over, why your neighbor has downright gone insane with her own Little Inferno, and why you're eternally stuck there just burning things for money. To give any clue to what the answers are would be to spoil the 'story', which even if the game is shallow in its gameplay department, its big twist near the end is, I say, worth price of admission, even if a lot of questions are never truly answered. Like World of Goo, not much has to be said when the music grabs you, holds you still, and just shows you without the need for dialogue. I'll admit, when you heed your neighbors advice near the end of the game and something big happens, I was brought to tears. Not much was said, and not much needed to be said as things played out and the music did all the talking.The eerie art style and somber, subdued soundtrack (save for more dramatic moments later) are easy on the eyes much like World of Goo, and its kinda fun to try and complete the combination challenges, where a list gives you the name of a combo and you must burn those items in unison to complete it and gain stamps, which you can use to instantly have an item delivered to you. These combo's are also required to unlock better catalogues and complete the game, making it somewhat of a grind once later combo's requiring three or four items get in your way. I completed Little Inferno in a little over three hours (all in one sitting), and that's including me getting through all the catalogues at a pretty good rate while goofing around to complete combo's. Even if I blew all my money with failed combinations, spiders creep down your chimney to give you small amounts of money, again showing there is no way to lose in this game, only win.At $14.99 (at this writing, it's currently $9.99 on Steam), I cannot tell you to go out and purchase Little Inferno, even if its ending is worth seeing for yourself after spending a few hours burnin' and burnin' some more. Due to Steam's Christmas sale, I bought my version for under ten dollars, completed the game in the one sitting, and have yet to come back to it, not even to complete all the combinations. Little Inferno is a one trick pony, plain and simple, but its one trick was one that brought me to an emotional level, considering all you do is just set shit on fire and get rewarded for doing so. World of Goo would be a much better use of your money since it's an actual game with conditions for winning/losing plus it has good gameplay, but if you ever have some money to burn and Little Inferno is on sale, go for it. You'll probably never come back to it again, but it's little, sweet story will certainly touch you, while it lasts.",

    "review_description": " This game is weird. You'd think after some 25 years of gaming you have seen it all, but this one is different. This is a game without a game. The whole game literally consists of you dragging stuff from the bottom inventory on the screen into the fire place at the top and then setting them on fire. That's it. There are no points, skill or anything. It's drag&drop to make things burn. Once you have burned a thing, you get more money that allows you to buy more things from a catalog to burn. The only game-like part of Little Inferno is unlocking new catalogs, as that requires you to figure out a little 'puzzle'. The puzzle however is simply to burn two or three things of a certain kind at once in the fireplace. The game will give you a little hint as to what those objects might be and then let you figure out objects of the catalog that might fit the description. But after that it's back to just burning stuff.On the technical and presentation side however the game is quite impressive. The graphics are extremely polished, the fire effect and light effects look great and lots of the items you burn have something custom animation or behavior to them. The game also has a bit story going on in the form of letters that arrive every now and then.Despite all the polish however the burning stays incredible boring, as there is no challenge to it. You get a fire simply by clicking the mouse. You are not limited to a certain number of matches, you don't have to blow on it or anything. If you want to set something on fire you just hold some fire to it for a while. There is no need to be careful about in what order you burn stuff. No real way to accelerate or slow down the fire and no need trying to keep the fire alive. Despite the large variety of items the game provides, none of them changes the burning process in any fundamental ways. It's all just cosmetic. Your flame might change color or a fan can suck in the flame, but none of that is relevant to the gameplay, you can burn bricks just as easy as paper or toys.Long story short, this game is essentially Cow Click 2.0. It's a game about clicking on stuff, waiting a bit and then clicking on more stuff. It's completely brainless. If you want to waste three hours of your life without using your brain, this game is as good as it gets. If on the other side you expect an interesting simulation of fire, stay away from this game, as while the fire looks nice, fire has never been this boring before, instead have a look at Trash Panic, it's a very similar game, but it mixes the whole destruction with some Tetris-like elements which makes it a lot more interesting and challenging.All that said, the game does have one redeeming quality, the ending. For the last 20 minutes or so the game turns into a point&click adventure. It doesn't add any puzzles and is very linear still, but this short point&click section is implemented incredible well and you'd wish they made a whole game in that kind of style. The graphics in that section have some subtle 3D effect going for it that makes them really stand out and that I haven't seen done in that way in any other game.",

    "review_description": "Knowing nothing about the game before I booted it up, it took only seconds of that Kyle Gabler sound for me to realize this game was made by those World of Goo guys. I've gone on record on more than one occasion to say that.. those guys are alright in my book. Little Inferno, broken down to its simplest form, is nothing more than a fireplace simulator. Here are these things, burn them! And those expecting a proper (World of Goo) game will definitely leave the charred ruins of your house disappointed. But if ever there was an example of a game that pushed gameplay aside in favor of atmosphere and character AND made it work, this is it. This game takes place roughly in the same expertly crafted universe as World of Goo. And more-so than its predecessor, there is a profound bleakness to it all that I absolutely love. The Little Inferno fireplace is the only bastion of warmth in an ever colder, dying city. The sun hasn't been seen in quite some time. So we continue to burn our possessions in hope that one day the city will emerge from this darkness. And that is the primary compulsion to keep playing this game.. to see what happens next. After a while, burning things will lose its novelty. Fortunately, the game's \"puzzler\" side provides riddles, combinations of items to burn together and the source of all the game's challenge. I'm not really convinced that side of the game is very compelling. But Little Inferno, like any good or great indie game, knows not to outstay its welcome. You can easily finish this game in anywhere from 2-4 hours. And in the end, I think you'll appreciate Little Inferno for how unlike it is to anything else. ",

    "review_description": " This is an odd little puzzle game (emphasis on \"odd\" and \"little\") which pretty much revolves around burning things in a fireplace. The gameplay, such as it is, is all about looking at a list of of combos and trying to figure out which items make up that combo. As you burn items, they spawn coins, which allow you to buy more items. As you figure out combos, they spawn stamps, which allow you to have items instantly delivered. You also need a certain number of combos to unlock more catologs to buy more items to solve more combos. So, really, it's a never-ending cycle with no lose condition that can go on and on until you work your way to the end. The ending sequence got a bit...er...\"artsy\" for my taste, but overall, I found this game to be a more-or-less enjoyable way to waste a cold evening.",

    "review_description": "Now and then you come across a title that despite having at its core a set of elements that seem too bare and simplistic to make up a full game, still manages to do something rich and compelling. I remember it being the case with Rock Band Blitz, I remember it being the case with a whole slew of mobile games, and it’s definitely the case with Little Inferno. Little Inferno is a product of the Tomorrow Corporation, a three man indie team consisting of Kyle Gray who previously worked on “Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure”, and Kyle Gabler and Allan Blomquist who helped put together “World of Goo”. The game oddly takes its inspiration from a television channel consisting of nothing but a looping clip of a fireplace, which the team reimagined as a kind of F2P nightmare of the Facebook and smartphone generation. Then they went and actually made that game, but with the intent of injecting some genuine fun into the experience. And so in 2012 they released Little Inferno, a game almost entirely about a virtual fireplace.A gift.Why burn things all day and night? Well, for the citizens of Little Inferno’s world, it’s always snowing. Outside your house the town is in the midst of a crippling winter and it’s getting colder every day, but you need fear not as the Tomorrow Corporation have given you the Little Inferno entertainment fireplace, designed to keep you warm and engaged as long as you keep burning toys and other belongings. The macabre humour of presenting an open fire as a children’s toy sets the stage for the comedic and occasionally dramatic sensibilities of Little Inferno.The gameplay itself consists of a simple cycle: Using the in-game currency to purchase items from your catalogue, placing them in the fireplace, lighting them with your cursor, watching them crackle away, collecting the money that falls out of them, and purchasing yet more items for your stay-at-home combustion. There is however an end goal to all this pyromania. The key to completing the game is to quite literally burn your way through all the catalogues, but each catalogue can only be unlocked once you’ve obtained a certain number of medals. Those medals are earned through discovering “combos”, combinations of items which you must burn together. Occasionally, you’ll stumble across a combo purely by accident, but most of the time you’re trying to work out which items you need to set ablaze from the combo names. For example, for the “Time Bomb” you need to ignite the Alarm Clock and the Mini Nuke at the same time, or for the “Dinnerware” you need to toast the Fragile China and the Wooden Spoon together. Punctuating your controlled arson are letters that you receive from a few other characters of the town, although the large bulk of them come from your scatterbrained, hyperactive neighbour Sugarplumps.The fire animations are one of the game's strong suits.The most consistent joy found in Little Inferno is that it’s just plain fun to set things on fire. There’s something invigorating in this kind of destruction and its captivating to watch the flames glow and dance. There’s even a kind of pacing to it, with your virtual ignitions starting off as fierce, roaring blazes, and dying out into almost relaxing embers. The basic experience is also coloured by most items from the catalogue doing something when they’re burned, doing something before they’re burned, or just by virtue of what it means to burn them. They can be a pleasant, innocent surprises like burning a corn cob and watching it turn into popcorn or something as unsettling and grotesque as burning a school bus and listening to the screams. While not every single item is overwhelmingly interesting, there are a lot of really imaginative objects in here which push the basic framework of the game to its limits. The interactions with the other characters also help break up the gameplay a little and are entertaining in their own right, even if Sugarplumps has a tendency to stick around and just play on that one personality quirk much longer than she’s really equipped to. It probably wouldn’t survive without that combo system though, which provides you with the same kind of comfy satisfaction you get when you solve a crossword clue and keeps the game moving forward purposefully. Now and then this system will hit a bump however, when it seems like a combo’s name is hinting at certain items but they aren’t actually part of that set. Think the “Polar Bear” combo involves the Freeze Bomb? That’s completely logical but nope. Think the “Manly Man” combo involves the Protein Powder? Rational, but you’d be wrong.In addition, remember that this is a game whose initial pitch starts with “What if there was a really awful F2P title, but…” and that foundation infects it. You see, when you buy an item it’s not instantly delivered to you, there’s a designated amount of time you must wait for it to get there. This starts out being a few seconds, but it’s not long before you can start buying items that take upwards of a minute to arrive, and by the end of the game you’re sitting around for several minutes for individual objects. Now and then you receive “Stamps” for burning items which you can use to skip that wait time, but of course if they could nullify every waiting period they wouldn’t be in the game. In a good video game there is always something happening, even if that’s something as low-key and quiet as clicking through a menu or walking up a hill, but Little Inferno deliberately goes out of its way to have complete dead zones. It’s made worse by there being a limited number of items you can have waiting to be delivered to you at any one time. These are mechanics that F2P designers purposefully build into their games to try and bore people into spending real money, but here they are in a game where you’ve already paid the price of entry. You end up fiddling with more interesting media outside of the game like iTunes or YouTube to try and supplement the experience, and what are meant to be some of the great, culminating moments of the whole experience become monumentally uneventfulIt's a consumer cavalcade.And that could be Little Inferno. A slightly unfortunate free-to-fireplace game with some cute characters and fun puzzles, but there are some more important overarching themes at play here. There’s a message behind this game and one that’s greater than just “Fire is cool”. There are periodic moments where you come to realise the slightly disturbing implications of only ever being able to burn anything you own, right down to the precious letters from your only friend, but it’s more than even that. A lot of the title’s overall intent is driven home by late game events that of course I won’t discuss here, but throughout it you can see a criticism of over-indulgence in mindless entertainment and meaningless consumerism.There are clear parallels here between the fireplace and the screens of our entertainment appliances, the catalogue is presented in a cheap shopping channel style complete with tacky marketing speak, the items you buy are frequently gaudy or ugly, and when you do buy something you get little meaningful enjoyment from it and certainly no long-term enjoyment. Your entertainment products are nothing more than that, products, and whatever you buy you just end up poking around for a few seconds of semi-engagement before you’re diving back into the catalogue looking for more items to fill your consumer lust. You start off buying a few items and that’s not enough so you buy a whole catalogue but that’s not enough and so on it goes, with you as the player character only ever ripping your gaze away from product listings or your fireplace to look at in-game menus. It’s not a healthy lifestyle, but the fireplace makes it a comfortable one.It feels like a pertinent message, especially considering that there are various corners of the gaming community which have a tendency to heavily invest themselves in video games and similar entertainment in ways that aren’t entirely self-beneficial. The game doesn’t dive into great detail and nuance with its message but it does manage to place it front and centre without it feeling like it’s too heavy-handed in its approach, and manages to ultimately deliver it in a warm and loving way as opposed to a hateful and harsh one. All in all, Little Inferno can almost purposefully bore you and has a few rough edges in its puzzles and character interactions, but its simple riddles, bizarre effects shows, and its gentle reminder to not just live your entire life in front of The Shopping Channel make the short time you spend with it something to treasure.",

    "review_description": "Ahh Another month of playstation plus and another free game, Whether you love it or hate it you must admit it has its charms. This month caught my eye with one of it's releases labelled Tricky towers. Now i'll admit when i saw the trailer i was not thrilled. It seemed like an average game with nothing really screaming must own about it but after playing it for awhile it seems to have its charms.First let's get into the game itself. The game is a multiplayer tetris like tower stacking game where you and your opponents each compete to build a tower to reach the finish line, I know the concept alone doesn't sound amazing but hear me out when i say that it's surprisingly enjoyable. It's what i would label a dessert game, a game that does not have the filling feeling of a AAA game but is a nice treat. The type of game you play when you cannot be bothered to sit through cut scenes or learn complicated controls. It has a quick start up so you can play it quickly and then leave whenever. In this regards it does it's job quite well. I found myself enjoying the small sessions i played. The matchmaking is great and i never experienced any lag related problems or glitching while online which is more then i can say for some games.Now while i do compliment the online aspect of the game i feel the single player felt a little lacking. Now don't get me wrong it has its fair share of features for offline play but at the same time none of these features felt like something i would play, It was a lot more enjoyable to just go into random games and compete. It loses its tension offline in a sense that I just don't feel competitive against a computer. I mean you cant brag to a computer so why bother trying? So the strongpoint of the game is clearly the multiplayer and i won't fault it for that. The game is being given away as a playstation plus game so faulting it for having a more enjoyable online aspect seems dumb to me.The mechanics also work nicely in the game each fall and movement of the blocks feels polished and fluent not having any significant lag between the movements. This kept the game flowing nicely at a fast past. The ability to control the speeds of the falling blocks is also nice especially in online where you begin throwing random blocks at your tower at lightning speed just so you can grab a power up and hurt your opponent. This leads me to another thing the power ups. One of the things that really gets it away from just being called tetris with a face lift is the power ups. These power ups can range from passive to aggressive, some being used to help build your tower while others are used to hurt your opponents. I found this a fun feature that helped the quick tension the game would build.Leading to me Having to decide between slowing down an opponent or helping my chances of building.Overall i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this game. While i don't see it as a must have game. It has that nice playstation plus feel, A good time waster game to play when you don't have time to sit down for a long period of time.I give the game a 3.5/5",

    "review_description": "I have been accidentally referring to Tricky Towers as “Tumble-y Towers” since its debut as a free PSN Plus game for the month of August. No, “tumble-y” is not a word but if it was it would describe these titular towers terrifically. At any moment they may tumble, crushing your dreams while giving your friends a joyous laugh until moments later when their own towers comes crashing down under the ever spiteful will of digital gravity. This is where the fun comes from with Tricky Towers, armed with Tetris blocks it’s a fight against man’s most basic enemy: gravity. Tricky Towers excels as a party game but manages to be interesting as a puzzle game despite being a tad shallow.Tricky Towers does a good job of explaining itself as soon as you see the title screen. On top of the title rests one S shaped Tetris piece at a 45 degree angle. Using the familiar suite of Tetris blocks you’re tasked with building a tower in a world where the blocks have weight and gravity effects their placement. You’re given a platform to place your blocks on and if the placement of a block doesn’t quite balance it can fall off the platform or, potential even worse, it could wedge itself at an angle that will destroy any traditional Tetris style tower you were working on. Now the tower’s at an angle, tilting and swaying wildly, blocks are sliding off into the abyss and a frantic panic begins to salvage some semblance of a stable tower.This is when pure joy takes over and Tricky Towers really shines. Even playing against strangers online it’s hilarious and relatable to glance over at a competitor’s tower and see it start to sway before crashing down to half its height as they slam new blocks on top of it in a reckless shamble. The nice part about this is that you’re next. Your tower is going to eat just as much shit and then the roles will be reversed and the universe will be balanced. Of course eventually someone is going to win but it will probably be because of a lucky power-up or by the will of the gods and because of this losing can be just as fun. When you win it feels like skill, when you lose the blame is passed to lady luck. It feels good to steady your tower and continue building upwards on top a crooked L block, it introduces a hurdle that can be as big or small as you allow it to be.The race is on.The challenges you’re tasked with fall into three categories with each having slight differences depending on if you’re playing by yourself or in multiplayer. There are races where you compete to build a tower reaching a certain height before your competitors do or before a timer runs out in single-player, puzzles where you stack as many blocks as possible under a certain height or a predetermined number in single player, and survival mode where you stack a set number of random blocks where every fall your tower takes removes one of your three lives all while your competitors are flinging power-up at you.Single player presents 50 challenges broken into 5 tiers which can get pretty difficult after the 2nd tier. About half of the challenges are of the puzzle variety which makes sense in a single player context but they can get pretty tiresome after multiple tries on the same puzzle. This isn’t because the solutions are obtuse or unintuitive it’s that the process of retrying a puzzle requires to you try over and over without having a lot of time to think it through. If you fail you start over. Maybe you like the placement of the first four pieces, well, you place them again and then try something new with the fifth. That doesn’t work? Start over, replace those first four and try again. All of the incoming pieces are shown, in order, on the right side of the screen but it’s not always going to be feasible to plan every move out in advance and if your plan doesn’t work some trial and error will be in order.Tricky Towers works best as a multiplayer game more in the vein of Mario Kart than anything else. The environment is against you and the player behind you is about to drop a literal piano on your tower. It's random without much reliance on skill which makes losing as entertaining as winning. With only three challenge types it could become tiresome especially if you don't particularly enjoy one of them but Tricky Towers is a perfect game to hop into for a few rounds which could quickly turn into an hour or two.",

And I wont lie, I love Telltale as much as anyone.  But the AI will bet randomly no matter what cards they have. Its like playing a kindergarten. They will make huge raises, only to fold the same hand seconds later. There is no strategy, it becomes a very slow game of pure luck. But you didn't come here for the poker, right?

    "review_description": "Will admit this straight away. I am not really a good  poker player. In the company this game offers I don't really need to be either. When playing against people you never know what to expect and too often you end up leaving the table with less money you started with. Well not with this game.  Telltale have taken Texas Hold'em with a all-star cast and planted these to a fictional bar called The Inventory. The cast consist of  Max,  Strong Bad,  Heavy from  Team Fortress and  Tycho. This seems like a odd cast and odd setting but it actually works.  Heavy     What you get is a basic poker game with some Telltale  humor. The cast are true to their characters and design. Action happens only around a poker table and only thing differentiating from a normal video poker is the witty banter between characters. Each player has $10 000 when starting and players are eliminated when funds run out. After player(you) has been eliminated the end-game can be watched or a new game can be started with new 10k.  Visually game is pleasing. Nothing fancy. Just a cartoony look in vein of  Sam and Max games. Only funny thing is the difference between characters. Max and Strong Bad got simplistic 3D look where Heavy is much more detailed character. Tycho being almost a cel-shaded.  Music is cool blues tunes that suit the poker atmosphere nicely. There is surprisingly lot of dialog. The chattyness can be adjusted which probably determinate what kind of re-playability value this has. Needless to say that the banter is not as funny the second time around. Max and Strong Bad     There is a bunch of  unlockables and achievements as hooks. The unlockables come in two forms. The more important being a Team Fortress 2 items. Which is one individual item from each character. New poker tables and decks are the second unlockable which opens from winning games.  This will not make you a better poker player and doesn't really give lot of  challenge if you know how to play already.Then again price is only £5 which is OK for just the funny banter.",

    "review_description": "Poker Night at the Inventory is a poker game developed by Telltale, which drops you into a seat at one of the world’s most secretive gambling dens, and lets you face off against four famous characters from video games and the internet in a good old-fashioned game of no-holds-barred Texas Hold ‘Em. Considering that Telltale first got their start with a poker game back in 2004, it’s not surprising that six years later one of the most notable poker-based video games on the market has been developed by the same company.   Your charming competitors in this game of gambling, intimidation, and judgement are Max from the Sam & Max games, Strong Bad from the web series Homestar Runner, the Heavy from class-based shooter Team Fortress 2, and Tycho Brahe from the Penny Arcade web comics.         This is the Trogdor-themed poker table. I think it's pretty pretty representative of Poker Night's general attitude. For the most part the rules are that of a simple poker game; everyone buys in with the same amount of cash, there are no limits to the amount you can bet, and the blinds are raised at specific intervals. As an added bonus you can also unlock items for use in Team Fortress 2 through play, but the real draw of Poker Night at the Inventory is seeing all of the characters in one place, displaying their characteristic flairs, and interacting with each other in a bizarre yet fantastic clashing of fictional worlds. All the characters are visually well-recreated, with Max looking just as good as he has in the recent Sam & Max games, the Heavy appearing to have even more facial detail than he did in Team Fortress 2, and Tycho and Strong Bad being fittingly rendered with an eye-catching cell-shading effect. The animations for the characters are enjoyable to watch, with each character displaying body language indicative of their personalities, from the Heavy slamming his fist down on the table when folding his cards, to Tycho coolly slouching back in his chair while everyone else is playing. The UI, the environment, and the smooth jazz soundtrack are also effective at invoking the atmosphere of the old-fashioned gambling den you’re playing in.    By far the best part of the game is the dialogue. Telltale manages to capture the personalities of the characters perfectly. Max is still a scatterbrained lover of violence, Strong Bad is still an arrogant braggart, the Heavy is still a trigger-happy stereotypical Russian, and Tycho is still a cold-hearted nerd. Voice acting for Max, Strong Bad and the Heavy is as good as ever, and although it takes a little getting used to, they do a good job putting a voice to Tycho, a character who has never before spoken outside of the confines of speech bubbles. These strong voice performances are backed up by equally good, if not better writing. The characters off-the-cuff quips are almost always entertaining and often highly amusing, and the game’s golden moments lie in the situations where the characters talk amongst themselves.   Heavy is credit to poker game, but only up to a point. Unfortunately, despite the undeniably high quality of the script, and the way in which it is delivered, the dialogue itself can occasionally be the downfall of Poker Night at the Inventory. The speech will sometimes get in the way of the gameplay, with players being forced to sit through dialogue sections before the next hand is dealt, but a far more relevant problem is that there’s only a finite amount of dialogue in the game, and after a certain amount of time the dialogue will repeat itself. Several hours in I felt like I’d heard most of what the game had to say, and while the game’s library of well thought-out rants and light-hearted one-liners is by no means small, the game hits a point where it runs out of tricks. While the “chattiness” of the characters can be turned down and dialogue can be disabled entirely, doing so disables the very thing which defines the game to begin with. When the sound, visuals, and other charms of Poker Night at the Inventory are stripped away you aren’t left with a whole lot. Remember that the game only lets you play one variant of poker, has no multiplayer, and does not let you customise your games in any way, making it a very character-centric experience. In the end whether Poker Night at the Inventory is the game for you all depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re just looking for a video game you can play poker in then there are far better alternatives to Poker Night at the Inventory, however, if you know some of or most of the characters in the game, and are willing to put down £3.25 for a few hours of soaking in the quirk and fun nature of Max, Strong Bad, the Heavy, and Tycho, then this game is everything you’ll want it to be.",

    "review_description": "Poker Night at the Inventory is a computer game brought to you by Tell Tale Games. You will get to play Texas Hold'em against some recognizable icons. Those of course would be Max (Sam & Max), Strong Bad (Homestarrunner), The Heavy (Team Fortress 2), and Tycho (Penny Arcade). You have all been invited to an underground tournament where you will have to pit your skills against one another. Done in the comedic formula that sets Tell Tale Games apart don't be surprised if there are some zingers in there.Graphically, once you've ramped up the graphics the game looks well done, there are some issues with the shadows on the Heavy on lower settings, but overall every character looks as they should. Tycho done in a more cel-shaded fashion is the only one that really is more open to player interpretations of if you like the art style or not. the voices in the game are what set this game up to be one hell of an experience. It is very enjoyable to hear the stuff that comes out of the players' mouths, and to take a peek into the random conversations that the characters might have with one another if they were to actually meet for a game of poker. The controls are about as basic as you can get them, you're going to use the mouse, and that's about it. So be sure that when you want to Fold that the cursor is over Fold and not Raise.Overall I know that there are those out there that find this game lacking, but for me I'm not that series of a Poker player so I actually enjoy the game, and get into it. I play a couple of hands, and then I move on to something else. There's that burning desire every time I sit down to play a round or two, but I know there are those out there who play round after round, and I can understand that the amount of substance in the game might be a bit lacking. Its fun to hear the funny lines, but in all honesty there's not a whole lot of them. If you play like I do that's probably not going to be a problem, but if you're trying to become the next Poker Star, that's probably going to piss you off. Now as you play the game you're going to be able to unlock different decks, and claim opponents' prize possessions (this happens randomly when they don't have the $10,000 buy in). You'll also notice that as you play your name is going to change depending on the amount of money that you've won or lose.I'm not saying that this is a must game, but it is definitely a game that makes for a good distraction, or something that you can relatively quickly get through, most times (unless one of the players just can't lose). There's enough of a game here for me, so I have to give this game an 8.5 out of 10.",

    "review_description": "This game, for being so badass a concept, is totally worth the measly 5 bucks it cost. I mean, how the hell can you go wrong with Max, Tycho, Strong Bad and the Heavy, with the most simple yet robust version of virtual Texas Hold 'Em I've seen yet? I mean, hell, it may not be saying much but this game taught me more about the game than anything else. The irreverent, crude humor and just overall FUN totally make it worth the 5-spot. I heartlily recommend you check it out, if not for the game itself, but for the exclusive Team Fortress 2 items and the crossover characters. ;D Review originally written June 1, 2011 on Steam",

    "review_description": "FlOwer deserves all the honour it can get. The developers have managed to dig deep into a small concept, and bring out something big. After being introdused properly to the controlls, flOwer takes you with it to a wonderful world of exploration and wonders. Taking you through emotional highs and lows, and at the end blossoming into the experience you would only hope to find at the end of the stalk. The game excells in all the areaes it tackles, but manages to limit the amounts of these areas. The game itself is made up of a simple mechanic: Moving the wind with the six-axis controller to gather up petals, but the experience of the game does not lie in the mecanic but in the visuals and how it makes you feel.This is to say, the game is made up of several elements, music, controlls, sound, visual feedback, colour, but the sum of these parts that make up flOwer give you a wholesome impression and feeling. This ride through emotions is what makes this game so great. When you finally at the end lay down you controller, you are going to feel as if you just experienced something great. This game deserves it's top grade for managing to limit itself in size, but still giving the player a feeling of having partisipated in something great. It does not in itself present a realistic challenge, and can thus be said to be an \"art\" experience\", but there is challence to be found if you seek for it. Coupled with excellent sound design, visuals and the most kickas credit roll you can imagine (I'm not kidding here), it has earned it's five stars.Elemmire",

    "review_description": "WHO SAID VIDEOGAMES COULDN'T BE REPRESENTATIONS OF ART?Flower is one of those odd games where a review can never really describe it best, it's simply one of those games where you need to experience it yourself to truly appriate what it is trying and achieves to do. Now avaliable for the Playstation 3 via the Playstation Network, Flower is developed and created by Thatgamecompany the folks who bought us the oddly enjoyable flOw. It's obvious almost insantly that the developers wanted to create something that would affect what the player is thinking or feeling rather then what they are doing. Flower is the sort of experience that will potentially greatly differ from gamer to gamer, because despite it's beauty and relaxing gameplay there is no denying that not every videogamer will understand or appriate what Thatgamecompany have created in Flower. What sort of person do you have to be to understand Flower? well I'm not to sure, but it's an experience that some will hate and some will absolutely fall in love with. NOT SURE ABOUT VIDEOGAME POETRY, BUT IT SURE IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE!As I stated previously, Flower is an experience which is tough to truly describe in a written review. Simply because every gamer will get something different out of the few levels that feature in this PSN title. Like flOw, Flower is quite a short experience and it could be debated if it truly is an actual game. I guess that would depend on what you class as a 'Videogame' though there is more to a videogame then shooting someone in the head with a rifle. That's partly one of the issues many gamers will have with Flower, those that spend most of their spare time shooting other gamers in the head might not totally understand it and might even find those that do enjoy the experience a little odd. Maybe I'm being a little unfair on those that do enjoy such gaming activities as I myself like nothing better then playing an online shooter, but what I'm basically saying is that there will be an whole class of gamers who won't ever understand why other gamers enjoy what Flower somehow achieves. So what is Flower? well putting it in simple terms Flower is a videogame experience where you are the wind. Using the Playstation 3's sixaxis motion controls, you travel around stunningly beautiful environments collecting more flower petals and curing each environment of darkness and depression. At first this isn't exactly clear but once you near to the end few flowers (levels) you realise that in a odd sort of way, you control a figure of beauty which is trying to bring beauty back to the darkness of the environments. Of course this is where you could look at this concept in a few different ways, you could say that Flower as a whole is simply telling us that beauty can be found in the ugliest of things. Flower features many beautiful moments.So you may be reading this and thinking, What? What the hell is this man on about? and that would be fair enough. I wouldn't be personally offended as that is simply what I got out of my enjoyable time with Flower. It will be a different experience for each and every gamer and for me I found it to be a very peaceful and relaxing one aswell. Speaking of which, you only have to spend a very short time with Flower to realise what a great looking title it is. Especially when you compare it to Thatgamecompany's previous title flOw which though simply and stylish had nothing on Flower. I shall not get into a console debate but Flower is a great example of the power of the Playstation 3 when it's in the right hands. You will never see grass look more beautiful in a virtual environment and it's an absolute blast speeding through the high tall grass as it slowly parts for the wind (you) and the following trail of colourful petals. It's actually worth stating that Flower is not all high green grass and wonderful sun covered lands for within some specific levels the environments can be dark and quite depressing. But on a style point, there is simply no denying that Flower is one of the most beautiful videogame titles avaliable today.The Playstation 3's much laughed at sixaxis motion controls actually finally make some sense in Flower, that's saying something in itself considering how many games tag the whole motion controls thing to most games on the Playstation 3. But it works well and the experience wouldn't be the same without it, I'd probably say this is the first game that makes Sony's decision to put in the whole sixaxis concept worth it and it controls well even if your wrist might feel a little sore if you miss a flower or two as you flow around the environments. The overall controls are indeed simple, with only the X button being used as that is the specific button to bring power to the wind. Even Flower's main menu is simple and stylish requiring you to aim at each specific flower (level) and holding the X Button to start that flower up. The game uses motion controls throughout but it does make sense and it doesn't feel as if it hasn't been thought out properly or if it's trying to attract the Wii crowd with it. So for that I give Flower great credit, it helps the sixaxis motion control system make sense and that is a huge thing. The experience had by the gamer isn't only through the eyes and mind, it is also through the gamers ears as Flower is a pleasant listening experience that even when being somewhat dramatic isn't painful to listen to. Infact it's an absolute pleasure to game to and here's hoping we might see some sort of official soundtrack appear on PSN sometime in the near future because I could easily see myself listening to some of those beautiful piano driven tunes again, maybe even when I'm relaxing or in the need to chill out a bit. The whole experience is partly driven by sound, which though simple is pleasant and matches the rest of the style of Flower pefectly. You are the wind.Most if not all of what Thatgamecompany is trying to achieve with Flower is achieved beautifully, it's just sad that more of a risk wasn't made with certain environments or that there wasn't enough variations in ideas along the way, because despite how much I enjoyed Flower. I couldn't help but think of unique ideas that would potentially work great in a game like this, I couldn't help but think that gameplay mechanics such as water could have been used to help keep the experience varied or that maybe even more risks were taken over what type of environments Flower's levels were set in. But these are my personal small issues with Flower, and that in itself feels wrong as Flower as a concept is a risk that was worth taking by the developers. Plus I don't know what Thatgamecompany were specifically looking to create in Flower, that's for them to know and for me to find out while playing this truly enjoyable PSN title. Flower being as short as it is, there was no doubt that I wondered about the possibility of seeing some downloadable content sometime in the future and I would personally be happy to purchase some if they offered ideas and environments as unique as the ones found in Flower. But we will have to wait and see if that is a future possibility. Though I suspect there will be enough PS3 owners out there that appriate Flower enough for it to at least be considered. But what is on offer in the current game, is indeed special especially the later two levels which truly show what the developers were looking to achieve and send across to the gamer while playing. They don't just look beautiful but they also have an odd sort of message along the way aswell. Thatgamecompany's co-founder Jenova Chen described Flower as it being like 'Videogame Poetry' and although I can see what he is saying in a odd sort of way, there is simply no doubt that much of what gamers will get from Flower will be personal to them rather then a whole concept idea first thought up by the developers. There will be those who simply won't ever understand it, but there will be those that get it's beauty and artisitc stylings whenever they play it. It is debatable if it truly can be classed as a videogame rather then art, but is that argument even worth discussing, why can't it be both. Flower is indeed a representation of art in videogame form and if that isn't your cup of tea then I highly recommend you stay away from Flower. But if your the type of person who can see beauty it's almost anything then you will find a lot to enjoy about Flower. It's currently selling on the Playstation Network for £6.29 or $10 I believe for those in the US, should you or shouldn't you purchase Flower will totally depend on your personal gaming tastes and what you look for in your games. But despite those that judge it before even trying Flower out themselves, there is no denying that what Thatgamecompany as achieved in Flower is a beautifully stunning and personal experience that is a fine example of why videogames and the folks who work in the industry are artists that deserve more credit in the artisitic world. As the gamer, well you get to enjoy some of the most impressive representations of videogame art to ever grace this wonderful form of entertainment. PROS!- Stunningly beautiful, with such a unique stylish soundtrack.- Helps make the Sixaxis motion control make more sense.- A mind affecting experience that you'll get something personal out of. - One of the best titles to hit the Playstation Network yet. CONS!- Might not make total sense to some gamers. - Very short, can be completed within an hour or two. - More could be done with the concept and level environments. SCORE:5 STARS OUT OF 5.Reviews by Joseph Bayliss (TrueEnglishGent)",

    "review_description": "Flower is the latest release from the makers of the game-slash-screen saver flOw, thatgamecompany,  released exclusively for download through the PlayStation Store at a $9.99 price point.  Flower is a game experience that, while short, makes enough of an impression with vivid colors and intriguing gameplay to recommend its purchase and repeated playing. Flower excels noticeably by doing effortlessly what so many other games have failed to do:  making the Sixaxis controls functional and enjoyable.  While some games, such as Ratchet & Clank:  Tools of Destruction, integrate Sixaxis controls intermittently and with varying degrees of success, some large-budget titles relying almost solely on Sixaxis have disappointed severely (do I need to specify which game I'm referencing here?).  Flower's control scheme consists of the use of one button - any button of your choosing - to alternate the speed at which your petals travel, in a cyclonic whirl, and the tilting of the controller for direction. This is an excellent game for significant others or disparaging parental units, to show them that video games are not all violence and blood, or time-sucking, life-wasting MMOs.  While there is objective-based gameplay available, it is not entirely necessary to complete the game - or even a level - to enjoy what is on offer here.  The parting of individual blades of grass as the wing and petals race along the ground, or the array of vibrant colors through levels light and dark are spectacles in their own right, and there is plenty of time to enjoy any of these aspects, since the game's levels do not have time constraints. One of the great delights of Flower is that its ease of controls and relatively free world and level design leave enough to interpretation that each player may approach it differently.  In this way Flower is a little like John Cage's 4'33\":  the experience and sounds are as much about the audience as they are derived directly from the game. Flower is a great starting point for someone just getting into games, or a great way to relax and enjoy a wide palette of color for veteran gamers taking a breather from more intense or violent games.  Its merits and low price point make it easily recommendable to anyone.",

    "review_description": "It's a relatively short game that will probably take most players 1-2 hours to beat depending on how much you want to explore the world. It's by the same developers of flOw so the same simple design and look applies here. But Flower plays more like a game since it actually has objectives and challenges, unlike flOw.The story, if you can call it that, is very surreal and simple. There are no voice-overs or text. Everything plays out in short cutscenes with music and sound effects. It's a very subjective experience and I'm sure people will probably want to discuss what the message is behind the levels in the game (if there's any).The gameplay is smooth and easy to learn. The SIXAXIS controls work great and are responsive. Moving the petals around is easy as pie. If you have the Dual Shock 3 with rumble, then that's even better since it's used to great effect in several areas. You basically need to guide some petals from one flower to another but that's all I will mention. The additional gameplay twists which come later should be discovered in order to enjoy the experience even more. Btw, the game has a lot of optional challenges for trophies so the replayability is actually quite high if you want the most out of it.Finally, the graphics and sound. Like I said, the graphics are beautiful and rich. The huge amount of grass and foliage is amazing to see in motion. There is no loading within each level you're in so it's very immersive. The lighting and particle effects are very nice and minimal. The sound is also surprisingly impressive. If you have a surround system, then you're in for a treat. The sound of the swaying grass and wind is very cool to listen to all around you and very well done. The bass is also excellent because whenever you clear a section or complete a level, the rumbling effect sounds also surround you to great effect. Very nice on both fronts.Overall, Flower is a great game with a unique look and feel. There were a lot of gameplay moments which felt like Rez that I'm sure fans of Rez will like. But it has the same melancholy feel as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus so fans of those games will like that too. This is a fantastic title for people who want something a little weird and outside the mainstream stuff. Highly recommended!",

    "review_description": "In a review about flower it's easy to go off on some pretentious tangent about how elegantly it evokes a sensation of happiness and relaxation in your soul with its soothing, mesmerizing presentation and the simple elegance of its unique design. It's easy because it's actually not that far from the truth. Flower may not possess the same qualities common in other games, and that's what makes it so appealing. And it's really hard to describe these qualities in a way that doesn't make you sound like a total hippie.Flower features tactile controls which after some tuning in feel like second nature. The presentation truly is wonderful, gracefully throwing pretty images and tunes into your face with great abundance. And there's more to it than meets the eye. There's a surprisingly motivating and engaging narrative involved, despite of its incredibly simple design. Simply engaging. I guess that sums up flower in its entirety pretty well.",

    "review_description": "Looking at Flower from a reviewing stand point is quite difficult. On one hand Flower is an amazing experience that can only be explained by playing it. But from a gaming side there is only so much Flower can offer.Basically you are the wind. Yes, that's right an invisible entity that cools us down during those hot summer days. But instead of cooling people down you control the flow of a single petal. The main premise of the game is to go around a field replenishing it with colour and light. You do this by hitting other flowers and eventually filling the once grey landscape with a beautiful array of blues, greens and reds. This may sound boring to some of you but mix together some very relaxing music and the easy pick up and play controls and you can almost start meditation whilst playing this game.The controls for the game are very simple and use the sixaxis tilt controls very well, actually this is probably one of the best games that has used the sixaxis control scheme. Tilt forward and back to control you high and side to side to control your direction. Then you hold down any one of the buttons to start blowing, basically accelerate. These controls will take you about a minute to understand and once you have you will literally feel as free as a bird in the sky.The presentation of this game is fantastic. The graphics are beautiful, from the lush grass to the magnificent amounts of colours you put into the world it all looks great. The sound works very well with the game with a nice relaxing rhythm in the background, while every flower you hit makes a different note to accompany the background tunes. At first glace it may look like a tech demo but I am glad that they kept a very clean looking visual presentation with no HUD or side jargon which takes you out of this world.The single player consists of six levels. These actually all vary and are all very unique from one another. For example in the first two you are doing the basic releasing colours from flowers but then in the next level you are starting up wind turbines and powering lamp posts. The game also has some exciting moments which I will not spoil. There is also a very subtle story to this game which is basically saying that our everyday life is filled with greys and blacks and needs a burst of colour and the end of this game is quite dramatic in the way it points it out.Even though it is only six levels each can be replayed and there are special flowers to find and collect. The trophies are another good way to extend the play time of this game as they set some very difficult and clever tasks for you to accomplish.Overall, Flower is an experience. I know you have probably heard it before but it is true. You can explain the simple gameplay and the beauty of the graphics but it is only until you have played it that you will fully understand. This game does not deserved to be judged by its length as I believe if there were more of the same it would only get boring. The price may seem steep but this game is unique and you will not get anything else like to from any other game.",

    "review_description": "Flower is yet another download-only game that shows that some of the most innovative and unique work this generation isn't to be found in the latest big-budget blockbuster.  It's the next project from the developer of flOw, and like that game, Flower is controlled mostly with the PS3 controller's motion sensor; is pretty relaxing to play, at least at first; and you can't lose, you just keep playing until it ends or you stop.  Unlike it's predecessor, there's more to the game than meets the eye at first, as it takes a turn partway through, and becomes quite the emotionally affecting experience.  It's so much different from the usual game design of killing everything you see until you reach the next part of the story.  Simply, each level begins with a single flower petal floating in the breeze.  Pressing any button causes a gust of wind to push it forward and tilting the controller changes its direction.  As you pass by other flowers, you slowly gather more petals until hundreds are traveling in your wake, and you become a force for good to heal whatever has gone wrong with the area you're in.  You soar around gathering specific petals to trigger changes in the environment, and eventually you'll have fixed everything and can move on the next area.  For whatever reason, the game generated some of the most visceral responses from me of any game in a long time, both in amazement at it's beauty and in shock at certain things later on.  It's a pretty technically brilliant game, and both the fidelity of the visuals and quality of the music, including interactive elements when you pick up petals, add hugely to the experience.  The first playthrough including the credits shouldn't take an average gamer more than a couple hours, which might not sound like the best value for ten dollars until you realize that that's basically what you pay for a movie of the same length.  It's fairly quick, but it manages to tell a full story and trigger a wide variety of feelings in that time, something very few games can pull off in the same period.  And there is some replay value too, with trophies that aren't easy to get the first time when you're just in the middle of the moment the first time.  Anyone who has a PS3 or access to one should definitely at least see this game for themselves.",

    "review_description": "The whole debate whether or not video games can be considered as art is still a mixed bag. While most games out today feel just like pure entertainment, a handful of others actually feel like a rare and special experience. Recent examples like Rez HD and Braid are rare gaming experiences that your mind was blown compared to games as entertainment. Flower is now the new artistic and special experience that is also calm and relaxing at the same time. It is another great example of how Playstation Network is filled with originality and taking more risks compared to Xbox Live Arcade and WiiWare being filled up with shovelware most of the time. The developers, Thatgamecompany, already established themselves with Flow early on with the Playstation 3's lifespan and now Flower is their coming out party with a crazy concept that keeps building up till the end. Even if flowers are not your thing, this is one of the best downloadable games on the Playstation 3 now and for ten bucks, it is truly worth it.The Flower experience is six levels long, but that doesn't mean you're totally done with the game. Even though you run through it once, there is enough replay value to play it as a game rather than an experience getting hidden flowers and trophies. The experience does build up as you progress similar to games like Rez and Braid where things would get crazy in the end. At first, it may seem calm and relaxing blooming flowers left and right, but later on it actually becomes a game along with the experience. Blooming various flowers and painting the levels does remind me a bit of Okami where the reward of completing the levels makes the world a cleaner and brighter place. Also rare these days in the Playstation 3's lifespan is that game relies on Sixaxis controls heavily. Those Sixaxis controls are among the best I have dealt with even though I have the system for almost two months now. Turning in various directions feel really good and accurate when slight turns require a slight tilt while sharper turns require a stronger tilt. Along with being a petal gathering more petals to proceed through these six levels, there is also the wind mechanic where sometimes you have to go on one direction in the later levels. Flower's gameplay can be played both as the experience and an everyday game.On the graphics department, you can tell that Flower is meant for the Playstation 3 taking advantage of the hardware. The game flat out looks beautiful from beginning to end as mixing in the wind effects and the environments together is remarkable stuff. It also feels like you're watching something on Planet Earth seeing nature in its high definition glory watching the trail of flower petals interact with the long grass having that whoosh effect. The same thing goes for the sound as well. When gathering more flower petals, Flower almost feels like a rhythm game similar to Rez as it triggers various sound effects. Unlike Rez and its techno style, Flower's music is relaxing and soothing as if you're in a yoga session or mediating. As a downloadable game, Flower is a pretty good showcase of the system both in audio and graphics.Flower is best as an experience rather than an actual game with goals. It can be played both ways of just playing the six levels casually, or as an everyday game with certain goals to accomplish which are usually for trophies. There is enough replayability for those players that want all the trophies, but for those casual players, playing it as an experience is good enough. It is a rare special experience that keeps building up to a climatic finale. Who would of thought that flowers can blow minds? Flower is indeed a game unlike no other and a great contender for downloadable game of the year.",

    "review_description": "There was a time when I first heard about Flower and it's whole abstract game design that I simply pushed it out of my mind as being a good idea. Now here I am, months later, giving this game 5 stars! Who'da thunk it?! The game succeeds mainly on an artistic level. The gameplay may be nice and easy, but it's nothing over the top revolutionary. The gameplay is actually something that is seen in the most basic of games. You \"collect\" things, basically. But instead of collecting, you are touching flowers and they blossom to life. It helps that it gives you a boat load of sensory feedback. Every touch is followed by a musical note. The resulting bloom is also beautiful. When touch enough of them and complete a chain then something marvelous and beautiful usually happens.I have to say, Brads review is also right. You'd think it would just be an open lovey dovey game about a flower's dreams.. but you'd be wrong. The game gets a little dark here and there, but that's actually really cool. It makes a cool relevant statement in a supremely georgeous way. Play Flower for the experience, not for the challenge. ",

    "review_description": "It really is startling to see how closely video games and simulated killing have become interwoven. Even child-friendly characters such as Mario are little more than pastel colored turtle squashers deep down. It is for this reason that Flower is so deeply refreshing, as this is a game that celebrates the miracle of giving a life instead of glorifying the act of taking one.  Throughout Flower's two hour \"campagin\" (and I'm using that term very loosely) players take control of the wind itself and restore life to desecrated areas. The feeling of flight, controlled using the Sixaxis' motion sensing abilities, is one of liberation. As more and more flower petals are added to the ever-growing procession, musical notes are queued and bright colors surge across the screen, creating a relaxing and absorbing atmosphere. It really is impossible to convey exactly what playing Flower is like without some hands-on time, because it is unlike anything else. It is, in a word, superb. If all of this flower collecting and relaxation don't exactly sound compelling, rest assured that there is a loosely structured game underneath Flower's relaxing exterior. Each of the six levels contains three hidden flowers that take some persistance to find, and themes such as purity vs impurity and modern society's impact on nature form a very loose story. Trophies also add extra layers of replayability to an otherwise pretty short game. Flower explodes off of the screen thanks to the rich hues of green, yellow, red, purple, and blue that saturate the game's presentation. The masterful usage of color serves to create a great contrast between the dark, unpurified zones and the pretty restored areas. In a way, Flower succeeds at manipulating our emotions without making it overtly obvious. The darker areas feel more genuinely depressing because of how they contrast with the elating pure areas. This is easily the prettiest game on the PSN, and with titles such as Pixeljunk Eden and Everyday Shooter already out, this is a huge accomplishment. The audio presentation is excellent as well. A nice orchestral soundtrack accompanied by ambiet sounds make for a very relaxing ride. Flower is as much a game as it is an experience. It is beautiful and artistic, and addictive because it is so relaxing. Simply put, this is one of the most inspiring games I've played in years. Graphics: 10/10: I've never seen grass this beautiful.Sound: 10/10: Always creates the perfect mood.Gameplay: 9.5/10: Simple and relaxing, but lacking a bit of depth.Entertainment: 9.5/10: Relaxing and refreshing, Flower is a real winner.",

    "review_description": "With consolidation of publishers and developers, increasing development costs, and changes in consumer spending, creativity has slowly diminished from the videogame industry. For every Braid, Pixeljunk Eden, and Mirrors Edge, we find five Gears clones, ten Halo clones, and a barrage of stagnant sports games. I’ve felt for the past few years that the saving grace of independent and creative gaming is the downloadable market. This is a source of distribution allowing one person, a group of people, or a small company to create unique and creative games.  This viewpoint is only strengthened with the release of Flower. Flower is something that I’ve wanted to experience since I first saw trailers a year ago. Flower isn’t about going from mission to mission or collecting orbs, it’s about giving the user a new and unique experience.  The game takes you away from the brash and harsh city environment and puts you in the midst of beauty; fields of grass and flowers. One small petal can bring beauty to the world, even though it struggles against unnatural forces. Flower shouldn’t be played like a normal game, and instead of pretending that you’re the petal moving in the wind, picture yourself as the wind merely influencing the direction of the petal. You shouldn’t sit down and expect to be rewarded with bonuses or power-ups, your reward is the petals effect on the environment. Flower should be played without giving the controls much thought; take in the atmosphere, that’s the only requirement. The purpose of this article isn’t to review and critique the nuances of the game but to influence people to experience it. Flower is a unique idea that few will try, but it’s something special that comes around so infrequently. If any of you have a PSN account, buy Flower, relax, and get ready for a breathtaking adventure.",

    "review_description": "Interactive entertainment (read:gaming) has been struggling to be accepted into mainstream culture for years. With the help of the Wii and Hollywood-style blockbuster titles such as Bioshock, Grand Theft Auto IV, Mass Effect, gaming marches on towards this goal. However, the “games as art” argument has been harder to support, until now. Flower is a stunning example of an emotional experience that can only be achieved in full effect in the video games medium.In Flower, you play as a gust of wind which is represented by a single flower petal. In the beginning, the main objective is to pass through flowers, activating events and opening up the next areas. As you progress, you collect a single petal from each flower you blow through and you’re soon represented by a long tail comprised of multi-colored petals. The Sixaxis motion controls dictate the direction in which you move while pressing any single button moves you in that direction, offering an intuitive way to direct the experience of Flower.Imagery of a colorless, unpleasant city is juxtaposed preceding each level in Flower, providing a stark contrast to the beauty and pleasant atmosphere contained in the first few levels of the game. The narrative in flower is told entirely through this imagery and experience playing the game. The gameplay evolves as the story progresses offering a few twists as the narrative changes.The narrative of Flower, without delving into spoilers, is about creation, beauty, destruction, and rebirth. The beautiful, vibrant world and the powerful ambient audio cues and music pull the player emotionally into the story of Flower. Flower is a two-hour experience that offers poetic messages and emotions about life, beauty, and the world. Flower stands as an excellent example of an artistic experience that can only be achieved through the gaming medium. For a mere ten dollars on the PSN, you’d be soulless not to get Flower.",

    "review_description": "   Personally, writing a game review is a daunting experience in this generation of gaming.  Games have followed the path of technology and have become incredibly complex and fascinating in their design.  But every so often we are treated to an experience that is simple yet exhilarating.  Flower is one of these experiences. By definition Flower cannot be consider a game given its lack of objectives and challenge and for the enthusiasts and purists out there I know I have lost your vote alone in this first statement, but hear what I have to say.  Flower is delightfully pretty.  Flower’s simplistic art design combine with its amazing colour, scale and clarity, makes Flower’s visual presentation simply unparalleled with anything we have seen up until this point.  Sure it may not be the most realistic and it is definitely not stretching any boundaries, but given the chance Flower’s artistic design will impress you on some if not every level of your appreciation for interactive art. So what do you do in Flower?  Well it is very simple.  You are the wind and no I don’t mean one of the people that helps summon Captain Planet.  You are simply the wind. Any button here will act as your momentum whilst the Sixaxis motion control will acts as your direction.  That’s it, one button and motion control, so sit back and relax as there is no daunting button combinations that you have to remember.  Your goal (if you can call it that), is to direct your wind path across the copious amount of flowers that are not quite in bloom.  Doing so will allow them to blossom and from each blossomed flower you will collect one petal which will add to the trail of your wind path.  It is quite invigorating seeing these trails grow and watching them mimic the every turn you make.  You will sometimes find yourself wanting to chase you tail, unlike a dog though, you will catch it most of the time.   At the end of each level you will change the environment in some drastic way. These changes can be either positive or negative, but they are always a visual payoff and are amazing to watch unfold. There is an amazing orchestral score here as well which adds to the relaxed atmosphere Flower is trying to accomplish.  It is even more astounding that you get a chance to either add to it or control it, given that you set of a note with every flower you help blossom.  In some cases you be blooming fields of flowers and in other levels the only music heard is from the flowers you bloom. In both of these instances you will feel like you are conducting your own symphony. Combine that with the sounds of traversing the lush grass or cruising through the thunder sky and your ears will swear that they have never heard something this rich and pleasant. Flower though, is simply not for everybody, nor does it try to hide that. For some, the $13 AUS ($10 US) price tag may be considered steep for the short experience that it offers. However, if you can get past that and have a niggling for something different, that isn’t a challenge but is a delightful beauty to behold, then Flower will have something to offer you.  For me personally coming off the back of playing MGS4, Far Cry 2, Dead Space and Killzone 2, Flower was the mindless and relaxing experience I needed to help separate my intense selection.  Simply put, Flower blew my mind away.  ",

I love the way it makes it clear exactly what you what you have to do how to do it without the need for any tutorials or written instructions.

    "review_description": "If you think Flower is not a game, or is just a pretty \"tech demo\" you'd be missing the point. Flower is another game on Sony's Playstation Network to appear that seems to set its self apart from what Microsoft is doing with Xbox Live Arcade. Flower is Unique. It's beautiful. And it's an incredibly soothing experience. Flower also has some of the best use of the Sixaxis motion controls we've seen to date, and believe me, that’s saying something.  Flower is simple. And when I say simple, it’s about as simple as a game can get. There are no \"objectives\" per say, the basic concept is to just fly a flower petal through the wind, meanwhile collecting other petals to add to your crazy petal wind flying, party train.  Each level is separated by a single flower pot inside what looks like an apartment in a busy city. The apartment starts out looking dirty, and depressing. But as you progress through each level, more life, and vibrant imagery appears in the apartment.  The gameplay is, as I said, simple. It is full on motion controls. All you really do is hold down any button, and use the motion functionality in the controller to steer the petals. As you fly through the grass fields, there will be certain flowers highlighted. These are the flowers you need to fly through in order to progress through each level. One thing to point out here is that there is no time limit. You are free to fly through the wind as long as you please. It may sound boring, but since the game provides an amazing soundtrack, simply doing that will give you an incredibly soothing experience that can’t put you into a deep trance. But of course if you do decide to go through the levels, as I’m sure you would, you'll want to look out for these flowers. Each level is different in the sense that the level designs simply change. You'll be doing the same basic thing the whole game, which is simply collecting flower petals as you progress through each level. But it almost seems as if Flower has its own personality, as you will find in a later level that it does to have a dark side to it.   For a downloadable game, Flower is gorgeous. The level of detail far surpasses most full retail games. The game supports up to 1080p, so if you got a good setup, Flower is a sight to see. Flower isn't a lengthy experience. You may be able to finish it in a couple of hours. Luckily the game supports trophies. So if your into hunting trophies, you can easily double or triple your experience. I love what Sony is doing with their downloadable game catalog on PSN. Flower is just another unique game that Sony has offered that probably would never have the time of day with other publishers. To wrap it up, if nothing else Flower is an incredibly soothing experience that after a long day at work or school can put you in a trance and make you forget your worries. Flower is $9.99 on the Playstation Store. Now go. Be the wind.",

    "review_description": "I would like to think that I am not a sucker. I have never responded to emails from a Zimbabwe based legal firm asking me to send them money so they can transfer a long lost inheritance to my bank account. I have never purchased anything from a television infomercial, regardless of how much it was being screamed about. I even understand that free internet porn isn’t so free once all the spyware, trojans and chaffing are taken into account. What I do not get is how this simmering pile of jaded dubiousness I call my gaming life was pulled in so completely by a few flower petals, some pretty colors, and some reasonably well implemented motion controls. Flower is not so much a game as it is a manliness endurance test. I failed, confiscate my chainsaw bayonet, I’m too busy floating around a meadow at sunset to notice anyway.If Flower was broken down and scrutinized on its individual pieces then none of it would make sense. The player takes control of a single flower petal, moves through six different levels via motion controls and the X button collecting other flower petals, and that’s it. The levels are never difficult, controlling the petal collection with the sixaxis is surprisingly effective and finding all the necessary flowers is not at all hard. So far it sounds like Katamari Damacy minus the giant ball and cows. The music will also not be winning any awards if taken out of context, offering new age guitar soundscapes with no tunes to stick in the players head. The only individual attention grabber that Flower has is its look, and even that veers dangerously close to Nvdia tech demos that pack in with over priced video cards. The logical side of my brain that counts frames in Street Fighter and spends hours grinding in mediocre RPG’s checked out and went to sleep five minutes in. Flower really isn’t much of a game, yet my soft, gooey side that only comes out after several beers and when no one is looking enjoyed every moment. Flower may be the best example of minimalistic/holistic game design that I have ever seen. It is everything that it needs to be and nothing more. The game play and motion controls compliment the graphics which are completely tied up with the sound. Nothing feels extraneous; even the ‘collect a million of this’ aspect (which is really the whole game) does not feel like a waste of time. Somehow, someway I cared about what was going on. By the third or fourth level, when the not so subtle nature vs. man conflict was introduced, the flowers themselves had become characters and the story just as effective and engaging and any forty hour RPG with a staff of hundreds and budget of millions, and this was done in less than two hours of drifting around grassy plains filled with windmills and hay bales. No words, no HUD, no inventory system, no high powered shotguns and independently modeled flying body parts. Flower is a very simple idea reduced down to the barest minimum; pure, short, and effective.Little gems like this are why I still turn on my PS3 and check the Playstation store once a week. XBLA may have all the big releases, but it has nothing this original. Games like Flower are a welcome relief from super high budget, soulless blockbusters. It packs more emotional impact into its ending credits then most other games can manage over hours and hours of ultra-violence. I didn’t care when Dom shot his emaciated wife out of mercy. I didn’t care when Otacon got laid in the back of an army helicopter, and I certainly didn’t care about Nico and his self induced family problems. I cared about Flower; there was a real emotional investment beyond rage at faceless internet opponents and low budget writing pasted on high budget effects. If I can abuse my imagined authority as someone who puts down words about games and hopes that people read them I am going to assign Flower as a must play. Swallow your ego, close the door so no one will see if you must, and spend a few hours without a reload button. If you are unmoved, then I give up, but I doubt anyone with an open mind and a spare $10 will escape Flower without it changing their expectations about what a game can do.",

    "review_description": "Flower is an experience first, a game second. I'm glad to have played it, but not to have paid for it. There is very little replay value in it for me, and for a game that took only an hour and a half to complete, that's a big problem. As a result of my experience, it's been difficult for me to recommend it to anyone.When I loaded it up, I was instantly enthralled by the look of it. It's beautiful. The music is perfect. The first three levels were fun to fly through while marveling at the individually rendered blades of grass and the way the flower petals drift languidly in the breeze when i laid off the accelerate button. I never really felt like I was playing a game, though. The game practically plays itself. While you can fly anywhere in the level out to the invisible boundaries, there's really no reason to do so except maybe to view the valley from a great height, if drinking in CG vistas is your thing. The game shows you exactly where you need to go, and often goes so far as to propel you along a predetermined route.The fourth level was the deal breaker for me. The game unexpectedly changes tone at the end of the level, but it does so in such a way where i couldn't help asking myself, \"Did I do something wrong?\" Of course I didn't. The game was just stringing me along down a path I wasn't really interested in following.The dark levels with the electrified barriers that follow are not fun at all, and I was irritated the entire time I was playing them. In think that this was exactly what the developers wanted me to feel, and I wasn't pleased with their decision. The final level is intended to be uplifting and liberating, where I was given the ability to smash the aforementioned barriers, but I was too annoyed to feel anything but my annoyance. Sprouting flowers were replaced by giant sprouting, textureless buildings that clogged the level and made flying just as tedious and cumbersome as it was while I was trying to avoid the electrified barriers. The pre-game screen for Flower says something to the effect of \"relax and enjoy\" and I found the latter half of the game to be neither relaxing nor enjoyable. I didn't feel that Flower lived up to its hype or to my expectations. That's not the game's fault, I know, but I feel its content would be better served as a three-dimensional IMAX experience than as a game.",

    "review_description": "Firstly, I just want to mention that you wan watch my video review at www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOPLrGEJT80Secondly, make sure to visit www.freezecracker.com, as that's where I post more of my reviews, video game music covers, and just anything related to gaming. Now, on to the review!Flower is the second game available on the Playstation Network made by ThatGameCompany, who previously made the ever-so-popular flOw. Flower and flOw appear to be similar: they both are controlled by the six-axis, they both don’t have HUDs, and both are meant to be relaxing. However, this is where the similarities end. flOw was a game with a great premise and a great mechanic, but the only problem is that the game just felt like a series of levels which let to the end credits. It never really gave you a sense of accomplishment, nor did it drive you to even finish the game. Flower is a different case. The gameplay, in Flower, is made up of you tilting the six-axis controller to control the direction of the wind, which in turn flies a group of flowers around. You can also press any button to speed up the wind and send your flowers soaring. Now, you might be thinking “what the fuck is this shit? Lair?” Well, let me tell you: this game gets the six-axis right. I have no complaints whatsoever about the controls. What you do in the game is you fly your group of flowers around and collect other flowers. There are many types of flowers you can collect that trigger different events whether it is starting up a windmill, opening up a new path, or sending you soaring through a canyon. Even though it seems simple, there’s plenty of variety to be had. Surprisingly, Flower offers up a deep experience behind the glorious colors and the relaxing vibe of the game. Basically, your main menu is a bleak looking apartment and you choose a flower in order to choose your level. The first couple of levels has you restoring color to the grey and damaged plains throughout the land, until it gets to the later levels. Now, I don’t want to give away too much, as discovery is part of the experience, but let’s just say that you end up serving a purpose for your actions within the game. There even is an ‘enemy type’, so to speak, within the game and you can even get damaged, though you can’t actually see a game over screen. This even escalates to the point where there’s a type of ‘boss battle’. Again, I don’t want to give too much away. What else can I say about this game? The graphics are fantastic, especially when your just above the grass as the wind makes a cut in the blades; the music is some of the best I’ve heard in a game; and it’s well-paced, there was never a moment where I’ve had enough of the game. Now comes the question: should you buy it? It’s only a 4 hour game on your first play through, and it doesn’t offer much replay-ability, other than trophies (which, in this game, are pretty witty) and secret flowers that can open up a hidden level. So, why should you buy it? Well, look at it this way: a movie costs 10 dollars, just as much as this game. However, this game is one of the most immersive and relaxing experience I’ve had in a while, more than what I can say for any movie I’ve seen lately. So, do yourself a favour: skip seeing a movie this weekend and buy Flower. 9.5/10",

    "review_description": "All games, to some degree, are designed to tease emotions out of you -- excitement, fear, joy, intrigue. What's so incredible about Flower is the emotions it brings out in such a compact, beautiful and simple game design. The pure joy of exploration, the elation of soaring through sky carried by wind -- these are to be expected. It's the final two levels of Flower which I didn't expect. (Even after knowing to expect something different, based on other reviews.) I won't spoil it, but I will say I didn't even consciously realize the game was having an emotional effect on me. I was just drawn completely into it like a great movie, except this character I identified with was just a simple flower.  Also worth commending thatgamecompany for their seamless design of the front-end \"menu\" and endgame \"credits\". This is a unified experience from front-to-back and a memorable, artful achievement in video game design.",

    "review_description": "  Flower really is an experience, and is proof that life is the journey not the destination and really you have to play flower to understand what it really is. Flower is about how the drudgery of city life has killed true beauty and you are out to bring back beauty to the gray and bogged down everyday city life. You control a flower petal and you help flowers bloom that result in gray grass turn green, wind-turbines turn, lamp-posts turn on and other such things. The visuals, music, sound, controls and everything about flower is top notch. This is great and is very relaxing to play through, however there are only 5 levels that total about 2-3 hours long from the first to last level, I found myself not really interested in replaying my previously unlocked levels, I usualy do replay fun games, but this game is so short that by the time I beat the game in (one playthough), I had just played the first level in the game less than 3 hours ago, it was just too soon to play the same levels again, while they are all of a very high quality, this game really would have benefited from at least 3 more levels. However flower being short, I still recommend it to those who take their time and just want to sit back and zone out as you bring life back to the big city, one flower at a time. A zen like experience that realy is unique and fun, while short. As a side note, it's the perfect \"girlfriend game\" due to it being engaging but still simple enough for her to jump right in with no prier knowledge of video-games.",

    "review_description": "How would one define a video game? Is it simply an interactive experience using images on a screen? Or is something not considered a video game unless it contains an element of skill or progression? While there may be differing views on the matter, one thing is certain: video games are more diverse in this generation more than ever before. For an ideal example, look at Flower, the latest downloadable game for the Playstation 3.Flower is an exceptional title for many reasons. Prior to its release, it became a heavily anticipated title for both casual and hardcore gamers. There are very few games that can captivate distinctly different audiences, but Flower managed to do so with its unique yet extremely accessible gameplay. In Flower, you control the wind using the motion sensitivity of the PS3 controller. The structure of the game has you guiding a sole flower petal around a large open garden making other flowers bloom along the way. As you make the flowers bloom, more and more petals are added to your trail, forming a visually stunning view of nature in all its purity. However, that structure isn’t the true goal of the game. The overall goal is to escape from your daily life and relax.There are no penalties whatsoever in Flower. You can control the wind as fast as you want using any button on the controller, and you can send the petal trail in any direction using subtle wrist movements. The motion controls work flawlessly in conjunction with the wind controls, allowing you to play the game however you wish. You might be the type to soar through the grass at top speed, or maybe you prefer to perform a gradual build up before triumphantly sending your trail to the skies. The game is literally whatever you make it out to be.The story of the game is also incredibly captivating in its simplicity. There is no narration or voice over to speak of. The game starts off by showing you a lonely flower pot sitting on the table of an empty apartment. As ambient street noises fill the room, you begin your journey into the flower’s world. After stepping into the garden, the anti-modernization message becomes apparent and soon the journey becomes quite emotional. Don’t be surprised if you become a little depressed when the street sirens of reality return upon completion of each garden.  By far, the shining stars of the game are its graphics and sound design. Each blade of grass is meticulously crafted and the wide array of color on display is truly awe inspiring. The sound is absolutely immaculate and it’s probably the stand out element of what makes Flower fun. Gentle orchestral music perfectly fits each garden and the sound of wind rushing by is incredibly authentic. Also, each flower that blooms creates a different musical cue, which also ties into the player created experience as you’ll find yourself almost creating your own musical compositions. Flower isn’t for everyone. If you’re the kind who needs some kind of challenge in your video games, it won’t be as easy to immerse yourself in a game that denounces challenge and stress of any kind. The game is also incredibly short. It only takes a couple of hours to see every garden, but there is added replay value in the form of collectible secret trophies. However, if you want a perfect experience to escape from the burden of reality, Flower is a must buy.",

    "review_description": "          I feel that a person's opinion of flower probably depends pretty heavily on their reason for playing games in the first place.  If you're a person who plays games for a challenge, if you want to get the high score, beat the bad guys and save the princess, then flower probably isn't for you.  It's short, easy, and doesn't really have any replay value unless you've got a thing for earning trophies.  If, however, you're interested in games as a fresh narrative medium or a means of escapism, it's definitely something you'll want to check out.                    flower is a game in which you play as the wind, soaring above lush green meadows, followed always by a colorful, fluttering tail of flower petals.  Technically speaking, the objective of each level is simply to get to the end, but to do so requires blooming a number of specific flowers; if you're willing to let yourself be taken with the game's premise, reaching the end of the level becomes secondary to making the world beautiful.               And it is beautiful.  Whether you're looking at the world from high above or breezing about at ground level, parting individual blades of grass with your passing, the game is stunning in its bright and colorful simplicity.  During the buildup to the game's release, a member of the design team referred to it as the videogame version of a poem, and while that may sound pretentious, this does seem exactly like the kind of game a poet—one who had become frustrated with the limitations of mere words in conveying vivid pastoral imagery—might make.  The visual splendor is complemented nicely by the audio, which consists of gentle, soothing music punctuated with the clear, ringing tones of flowers as they bloom.            What's especially interesting about flower, though, and what makes it more than just a simple piece of escapism, is the fact that it also seems to be about escapism.  In between levels, you're given a view of an apartment; a small, drab, unwelcoming place whose only bright spot is a shelf adorned with flowerpots.  Once you've selected a level, you're treated to a selection of scenes from the city.  These are mostly still images with appropriate sound effects playing in the background, and they have about the same flavor to them as your apartment.  Everything you encounter outside the levels themselves is fairly unpleasant.  These glimpses of the real world set the rest of the game in a context that's actually kind of depressing, although things slowly begin to improve as you approach the end.                      A much more severe change in tone, however, occurs in the levels themselves about halfway through the game, and it makes flower an interesting example of interactive storytelling.  Without this tonal shift, I probably wouldn't have thought of flower as having a story at all, but with it the game becomes a complete narrative, with a buildup of conflict, climax and resolution.  This is made especially notable by the fact that the game has no dialogue or easily identifiable characters.            As a game, flower is short and simple; as an experience it's striking and original.  Whether you think it's worth the price of admission will be contingent upon your attitude toward games, but for my part it's one of the most memorable things I've played in a long time.",

    "review_description": "The PlayStation Network is quickly becoming one of my favorite things about owning a PS3. No, it's not because you can play multiplayer titles for free across it, but instead there's this little outlet called the PlayStation Store that is becoming chock full of games that are creative, entertaining, and buck the status quo by taking chances outside the typical spectrum. For some reason developers feel like they are able to take more risks with PSN titles than on Xbox Live Arcade, and we are better off for it.  Enter Flower. A title developed by ThatGameCompany that is not really much of a game but is a completely engaging experience from start to finish nevertheless. You play as the wind and it is your job to guide a single flower petal throughout five different levels exploring widely ranging landscapes while picking up a swirling train of additional multicolored petals.  Controlling the wind is simple enough. Pressing any button on the PS3 controller initiates your forward flowing breeze, while the SIXAXIS's motion control is your steering wheel. There's no arrow pointing you in the direction you're to go, no heads up display or concrete objectives. Instead, the game encourages you to explore the lush scenery yourself, sometimes floating carefree and whimsically through the air, while other times avoiding potential hazards that could hinder your progress.  Speaking of the lush scenery though, this game is certainly a sight to behold. Showcasing an impressive 200,000 simulated blades of grass on the screen at a given time, there may not be anything that comes close to the visual fidelity of Flower on the PlayStation 3. It is gorgeous and all presented in 1080p. Vibrant colors literally explode from every corner.  When I first started Flower and entered the first level, I spent about 5 minutes just marveling at the beautiful landscape before me with the serene audio lulling me into a conscious trance. When in action, musical tones were provided by the landscape itself and the plethora of flowers that decorate it allowing a dynamic melodic experience that seemed perfectly fitting while swooping down low through the parting waves of grass or soaring high above the game's majesty.  You can plow through Flower in about two and a half hours if you'd like, possibly less without bothering to really hit up much more than necessary but while some may feel this is a drawback... it is exactly as long as it needs to be. You can lengthen the experience by heading back in to try and unlock all the trophies, which you may just do while showcasing this visual feast to all the visitors to your abode. Flower is also perfectly acceptable as a screensaver.  Its easy to equate this title to poetry or enter it into the 'games as art' debate, but it does present a story complete with its own message that will play out over the different levels. It appears to take place within the dreams of different flowers that look out over an urban landscape all day; what you take away is completely up to you.  In general, I'm not a fan of poetry or motion controls but I am a huge fan of Flower. It is a game that any PS3 owner should try, putting a few hours in to get a simple yet beautiful experience. Who knows, you may even come away more enlightened. Without the PSN, this game would not be possible. I can only hope that future entries into this experimental space turn out so wonderfully.   The GoodOne of the best looking games available for any systemExudes quality from every single blade of grassAs proficient aurally as it is visuallyThe BadSome may think its a bit heavy handed with its environmentalist messageThe UglyIndustrialism",

    "review_description": "Flower is from the people that brought you flOw, and even though I have yet to play flOw I can tell you that Flower is an experience that you won't want to miss. In Flower you will be taking on the role as the wind, utilizing the six-axis controller you will breeze around the stages collecting flower petals from different flowers.The music and the sound alone make this one hell of a ride. The music draws you in and intangles itself with the visual experience that you receive. To be completely honest the music will evoke emotions in some because of the powerful way that it is used.The graphics are stunning, grouped with the music it is a beautiful piece of art. Each stage has its own life, and the way that you interact with it makes it unique over the others. The effects on the grass as you fly low to the ground are very impressive, and the overall trail of petals that you will gain look stunning.The controls as stated before utilize the six axis controller. You will be moving the controller around to steer the wind and your trail of petals, but you will also have to utilize one button of the controller to speed the wind up for those longer journeys around a level. I personally recommend the R2 button, as it didn't seem to take away from my experience and it seemed where I naturally place on of my fingers.So the gameplay is simply this, you are the wind you pick up petals from flowers, certain flowers once the petals are taken will change the look of the world. There are hidden flowers that can give you bonuses, but its not required to beat the game. You will live out the life of each flower that you see on your desk / start menu. This may not be the best example for the word 'game', but this is an experience that I think everyone really needs to experience. If you have a PS3 you should play around with this game, it is soothing, relaxing, and enjoyable. There are those who say that this is just a subliminal campaign for save nature, and I can see what they are talking about, but that should not detour anyone from playing this. Flower gets a 9.6 out of 10.",

    "review_description": "Flower opens up to a vast concrete jungle; giant, steel skyscrapers tower overhead, while massive cranes continue to build upon this ever expanding man-made metropolis. At ground level cars bustle by to the hasty speed of city life, and the only sound to be heard is that of thunderous construction work and the power of a V8 engine. For many it will evoke emotions of stress - a disrupter of peace and relaxation. A stark contrast to everything Flower is.  It may take place in this dark, gloomy, colourless world, but everything in Flower happens within the dreams of an actual flower. It sits there by the window of a high rise apartment, looking out at the city, thinking of a place much more beautiful and serene; a place of nature. So you’re transported into this alluring world with no explanation at all. Luckily, Flower is a very easy game to get into; any button on the controller controls the wind, whilst using the Sixaxis allows you to guide a multitude of petals across the landscape. This may sound like bad news - the Sixaxis hasn’t exactly performed thus far - but it only takes a moment to get to grips with, and works flawlessly. You’ll be flowing across the elegant landscape within no time, controlling the wind to thrust yourself forwards, gathering more petals as you brush through each individual blade of grass. You see, your objective in Flower is to guide your petals across the environment, collecting other flowers to inject some much needed colour into the world - in the same vein as Okami or Prince of Persia. It sounds effortless and it is, but you can tackle it any way you want. Ideally you want to take things slow, soak up everything the game has to offer and just relax. There’s a sense of spirituality here; it’s easy to get wrapped up in its charm and float off into another world, almost as if you’re daydreaming or even meditating. No other game I’ve played has given off this feeling. There are no punishments, no time limits, you’re free to just sit back, unwind and relieve yourself of all life’s problems.  And this majestic gameplay is reflected in the visuals. To put it simply, Flower is a stunning game to look at, both in terms of graphical power and art direction. You have these massive, sweeping fields and each blade of grass is it’s own entity. It will twist and turn in the wind, parting down the middle as the petals flow through it. If the message of Flower is the beauty of nature, then they got it spot on here; even managing to intersperse the grassy fields with man-made machinery to create something visually appealing, despite the fact it goes against everything you’ve witnessed in the game up to that point. When I look at Flower I see a game encouraging people to embrace nature. Not in a way to discourage items we use in every day life, but to show there are two sides to the world and we should respect both equally. It shows a bustling city as a dark and unpleasant place, yet still manages to embrace certain objects such as artificial light or wind turbines as important and useful tools. We need things like this but we also need nature to show us how to relax and cling onto the joys of life. If you don’t want to seek out Flower’s unspoken meaning and interpret it for yourself, then there’s still plenty here to enjoy. I’ve reached the point where I now own more PlayStation Network titles than retail PlayStation 3 games, and Flower is definitely one of the best. The objective based gameplay can get in the way of exploration at times - sometimes blocking certain paths - but on the whole you’re free to do whatever you want. It’s short at around two hours, so traditionalists will want to spend time trying to find every hidden flower to add some much needed replay value, while others will just want to play through it again for the experience.  Flower may not be for everyone but if you go into it with the right mind-set then you’re guaranteed to witness something exceptional. Whether it’s the subtle notes you play as you brush past each flower or the firework effect of bringing a field to life at night; each of Flower’s levels are unique and offer something for everyone. As a cheap download it’s a game everyone needs to at least try, some way or another. If you’re reincarnated after you die I want to come back as a flower and play out these daydreams all over again.",

    "review_description": "Flower is unique, at least in my experience.  Many games have blurred the boundaries between an innovative piece of art and a fantastic gaming experience. Okami, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and many others have pushed the definitions of video games from what is known to a realm where immersion into a splendidly realized environment takes priority over flash and mayhem and/or extensive plot.   However, of the games I have played, Flower accomplishes what few have: a totally immersive game experience that uses great new technologies to really stimulate the mind. The premise is simple: you are the wind. That in itself is completely unique. As the wind, you blow petals and pollen from flower to flower, to bring back the color and life to a world gone gray. While this may sound dull, the realization of it is absolutely amazing.   To control the wind, you use the motion control aspect of the paddle in the best use of the Sixaxis controller I have seen yet. Amazingly, its not frustrating at all; it is actually quite responsive and easy to do. However, while the game is incredibly easy, that is not to say that it does not encourage practice for perfection. For me, this is where the real strength of the gameplay in Flower comes in: its replayability.  That's right, its replayability. The whole of Flower takes about 2 hours to get through, if that. On subsequent replays, there is nothing new to get, few trophies to acquire, and no new plot developments. However, if you take the time to learn the boards, and can rush through them without letting up on your speed, you will see something incredible. Subtle, perhaps, but absolutely beautiful. What makes this so is that each and every flower you touch sounds a tone. Different colors of flowers sound different tones, and the flowers are arranged in a way that one can, with practice, hit them in a perfect succession. If you can do this, the sounds of each flower, combined with the soundtrack and the sheer speed with which you can rip through the levels make for a spellbinding, adrenaline rush of a mellow game. Chew on that contradiction for a bit, eh? I've already played each level three times, striving to hit each flower perfectly without letting up in speed. When I can, it's nothing short of breathtaking.   The visual and audio aspects of Flower are something to behold. They really are incredible. With the ease of using the Sixaxis, you are able to bend and wind your way seamlessly around the environments and notes sounded in a way that is complete eye and ear candy. Some moments made me feel like I was on drugs (not that I would know; ). Breathtaking, astonishing, and powerful all do little justice to describe the beauty of the visuals and sounds of Flower.  As stated, the length of the game is incredibly short, and it has been criticized for such. However, I feel that if the game were longer, it would be too long, simple as it is. The truth is that Flower sets out to show you something, and it does exactly that in just as much time as needed, without adding on any fluff or unnecessary nonsense. Add on to that that Flower costs about 1/6th of most new games, and is about 1/6th as long as the average game (though with much more inherent replayability than most imo), and you have a great game for the cost.  In conclusion, this game is amazing. Nothing I've played has so seamlessly integrated a powerful artistic expression with the medium of gaming. If you like beauty, you would do well to at least give this one a shot.    Cheers, y'all, and happy playing…   P",

    "review_description": " Flower is simply one of the most beautiful awe inspiring games I have ever played, the review can end there, Go download Flower. A strange title to say the least, flower is about as unique as they come. Coming from That game company, the studio behind Flow. There is no real protagonist to speak of, you control the wind blowing a small flower pedal through a grassy field. Opening other flowers as you touch them, gradually bringing the world to life and amassing a trail of pedals behind you. Speeding along the ground with dozens of peddles in your wake, wind blowing, grass pushing aside, the effect is quite stunning. Control could not be more strait forward or more apt, one button is all that is required to play, in fact any button will do, simply hold it down to begin to fly, steer with the controller. The motion control is a bit flowy, but since you are the wind it fits. Give it time and you will be making quick 180s and doubling back in mid air.   Remarkably there is a story to be told here, each level is a flower growing from a pot in a city apartment, as the sprouts bloom the world slowly changes. A slow reveal, without spoiling anything, all that can be said is that each level takes you to a new environment and as the game nears its conclusion,  darker, more dangerous surrounding. The Apartment begins, like the dream worlds of the plants, to become more alive and colorful. No enemies to speak of, only obstacles. There is a game here, its not just flying thru fields of pansies, tight control and fast movement are a must in the later levels. Visually stunning, almost distracting at times. Some of the best grass to ever grace a game, the wind blows dust into the air, the sun sets and rises, rain pelts the land, A glorious vision of nature. Early levels are calming even relaxing, Later on as the game becomes a bit more challenging. Completing and bringing life to the darker last few worlds, A tremendous feeling of achievement in beautifying these environments. Partial effect galore, almost to much to take. Truly a showcase for the PS3s capability's, and the power of minimalist design. To really take advantage of the showcase play on a 1080p display.   For ever flower that is activated musical que is played, along with the background track a haunting score is present, building up ebbing and flowing with your actions. It can be almost hypnotizing, the visual sights and an ever changing reacting score. Only adding to its already mesmerizing nature. In the End Flower is a Marked achievement, a new benchmark in the Games are art debate. I loved every second I played and would linger in an atmosphere long after the task was completed, twirling and racing through the grass. A message of Environmentalism, Urbanization, and industrialization are at its heart, never preaching, only a slow methodical approach. Showing us the true beauty in the world. Growing great meadows of flowers. And in some cases breaking down steel monoliths, building the world anew. On my short list for game of the year. Maybe the most beautiful game I have ever played and not just visually, this game has heart. If you own a ps3 then you need to have this game, flower is not a game but an experience, a living interactive art piece. It is soft, delicate, yet powerful and moving. A landmark downloadable title, unrivaled in its beauty and artistry.   Axellion,  ",

    "review_description": "Just grit my teeth throughout, and i haven't swore as much at a game in a long long time, at least not for these reasons.   To me, Flower is an awkwardly motion controlled conflict-free Pacman with generic (though technically impressive) visuals, INFURIATING soulless self-help-tape soundtrack and attempts at creative narrative that challenge on the level of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon episode. It asks little to no skill of you (which is fine), and throws you into a constant collectomania chore or ticking off flowers to paint the world in brighter colors, coupled with generic audio cues. The completionist in you will hate it for the awkward controls and slow pace as you wrest the fucking flower blob thing around to get that ONE flower you missed, only to have the game decide you've done enough and yank you off to where it next wants you to go.  Imagine a laggily motioncontroller pixelhunt that has no problem yanking you off against your will because it wants to show you some more fucking windmills or particle effects. All the while you're forced to listen to ambiguous generic synthesized guitars over generic pads and there is no fucking emotion to anything. It's a blank slate of a game that throws a ton of particles around and expects you to be hypnotized by it. I was hypnotized into a seething rage and a wish to go punch Jenova Chen and his magical theory of fun right in the face area. Don't even get me started on the whole \"it's a poem in game form\" bullshit. I love poetry. This, if it's poetry, is poetry written by someone really fucking bad at it.  Surely we've grown past this kind of piss? Are we to accept a challenge-free game with lazy pretensions at art because it's \"poetry\"? Aren't we allowed to call a horse a horse and identify BAD poetry? Fuck it, I'm going to make a game where you're a bubble traveling through water and you join other bubbles to make bigger bubbles and you reach for the sun and WOW IT'S SO PRETTY AND oh no i hit the surface and i burst, and now i am nothing. Sadness fills me.  This was an experience to cherish. Fuck that formula, and fuck this game.",

    "review_description": "Lots of people will try to tell you that Flower is not a videogame, and that it is actually some sort of interactive art. Don't listen to these people, as they are wrong. As beautiful and awe-inspiring as Flower is, it does have some very clear goals and objectives. The core of the game revolves around controlling the wind using Sixaxis controls to steer your flower petals around a vast environment, collecting more petals to open your way forward. As you do this, the landscapes of the game gradually change from bleak, barren fields to lush, vibrant meadows.   The general controls of the game work extremely well, making this probably the best use of Sixaxis controls so far on the PS3. The speed of the wind is pressure sensitive, so the shoulder buttons end up being the best choice. But the true draw of the game is the visuals. Watching your stream of petals fly majestically through the air as you restore color to the world is one of the best examples of the PS3's power thus far. The final level is so rewarding in the way that the narrative sets it up, it may be worth the price of admission alone.   Don't let Flower's pretty looks and whimsical nature turn you off. It is one of the best offerings that PSN has to offer, and a great experience for the asking price.",

    "review_description": "The modern gaming landscape is littered with countless sequels and me-too copycats lacking any form of originality. Even those few games that attempt to do something fresh usually fall into the traps set by previous games, with archaic features like limiting save-points, incompetent AI, or even more generally, a classic zero sum architecture, in which there is a clear winner and a clear loser. As our medium evolves though, the term \"game\" becomes more limiting, as new interactive art pieces create gaming experiences that transcend the classic win/loss structure that games of all types have been historically based upon.One such game is Flower by Thatgamecompany and Sony Computer Entertainment. Some will decry Flower as heresy, saying it undermines the very definition of a video game, and in a sense, they will be right. Flower isn't like any game you have played before, and whether you can stomach its unique blend of interactivity and social commentary will be entirely dependent on your ability and desire to see games as something more than the toys that Nintendo so desperately wants to make them into. Flower is more a piece of interactive art than a game. You play as the wind, guiding flower petals into flowers to make them bloom, thereby adding their petals to your ever increasing chain. You steer the wind with the motion controls and move forward by hitting any button on the controller. It is easy to pick up and easy to master. You never earn any new powers, and the entire game is built around variations of this basic premise. If you think that sounds shallow then you'd be right. Flower isn't about deep, demanding gameplay. If you play games to master complex controls or develop ever more powerful characters then Flower isn't the game for you. Flower is about experiencing the world created for the player, and it is inarguably better for it.Flower delivers a powerful and moving message about the dangers of industrialization and the beauty and majesty of nature. It does this without any dialogue, settings, or characters. In the ongoing battle between ludology and narratology, Flower is definitive proof that narrative and gameplay can not only coexist but can work together to deliver a more powerful message than either could separately. The story in Flower is told through gameplay. While traveling through these six unique worlds players experience a range of emotions that are rarely generated in a gaming space. Flower proves that games don't need complex narratives with dozens of characters and apocalyptic settings to be successful. It's simple story and lack of characters or dialogue transcend the limitations that constrain print and film media. This is truly a story that could only be told with a game.While gamers often claim that graphics and audio are secondary to gameplay, Flower is an atypical example. Flower makes good use of narrative spaces, a storytelling technique best suited to interactivity, in which the story is told less through characters and more through the settings in which the characters are situated. Flower's incredible audiovisual presentation is paramount in delivering its message. The beauty of the first four levels makes the player care deeply for the well being of the world presented to him. Each blade of grass is individually animated, and each flower has its own note associated with it. The player can make a virtual symphony that changes the soundtrack dynamically depending on what flowers the player adds to his chain. Flower attempts to prove that nature is a piece of art, and through the successful blend of interactive music and technically and aesthetically superb graphics it succeeds gloriously. When the setting turns dark in the final two levels the player feels the change in tone. While the mechanics remain the same, the game fundamentally changes solely through the alteration of audiovisual style. Essentially, by using narrative spaces instead of classic literary means of storytelling, Flower increases the importance of presentation, making variations in mood the primary aspect of both the narrative and gameplay variety. Flower is a truly monumental achievement of interactive fiction. It is fitting that Thatgamecompany, with its origins in academia, would be the one to take the academics back to the drawing board, delivering a game with both a story and a message, while leaving out entirely the backbones of classic literary and cinematic narratives. There may be no characters, enemies, or even a way to lose, but Flower is stronger for it, pushing the medium in a new direction. Whether that direction, pulling elements from the controversial New Games movement, is the right direction for the industry will undoubtedly be argued by gamers and scholars worldwide for years to come, especially as the era of widely distributed, cheaply made, indie games continues to flourish in this age of online distribution. What is inarguable though is that Flower will surely prove to be a seminal work in gaming history.    ",

    "review_description": "Braid was a 2008 release starring a self-loathing British stalker capable of using the powers of Shame and Regret to manipulate time in unsavory fashions. All of this may or may not have been a metaphor for the atomic bomb, or the destructive nature of human obsession, or something completely unrelated. It had the right kind of ambition of boosting the games-as-art argument, but the problem was that the developer (all one of them?) knew this. So they (he?) took every chance possible to preach and shove different waves of text and imagery down the player’s eye sockets in an attempt to create the snobbiest game of all time. Perhaps he believed he can get away with anything and get away with it, being that the game was released during a Gears of War year. (And I believe it is no coincidence that the PS3 port was released on an Uncharted year.)  Anyways, the reason I like Flower so much is because it is everything that Braid is not.    The main HUD looks kind of like where you'll be living when you grow up.     Instead of providing one paragraph after another of obtuse text who’s relation to the story is questionable at best (and a crock of time-aged scat at worst), Flower never provides a sentence more complex than “Press Any Button.” Where Braid tried to confound the player by insinuating hidden contexts for every block, enemy and stage-logo, Flower sticks to a consistent theme (in this case, nature. Because nature is the hip thing in  right now.) And in sticking with that theme, Flower is able to evoke dozens of different ideas, feelings and interpretations. How the Blackberry-strapped businesswoman climbing the ladder of a male-dominated NY corporation views Flower will be different from the labour-driven farmer from Delaware who thinks business should be a male-dominated world. But both will feel something profound, something special.  In Flower, you control wind. Or the Hand of God. Or fate. Or the spirit of Michael Jackson. Who knows. Your playground is this open field where assorted glowing flowers go to be admired. And by breezing through them, the flowers feel so aroused by the wind that they blossom and ejaculate pedals. So your breeze of orgasmic wind becomes a spiral of hot messy flower pedals. Flying over certain groups of flowers will cause flashy effects resulting in segments of the area to come alive with colour and vegetation. And you keep flowing from section to section until the power of Love liberates the entire field. Since the game has the simplest control scheme possible (press any button to move yo!) and the wind has a pretty decent view of the world below, this is a game that even the most video game-inept human can pick up and feel proud of themselves.  The first few levels of Flower feel like the combination of a tech demo and a car commercial without the car. Colourless areas suddenly spring to life at the presence of your speedy invisible vehicle, while subtle musical cues and a soft-hearted soundtrack pluck at the strings above your aorta. All that’s missing is the kid whispering Zoom Zoom.  Then Flower takes a surprisingly dark turn, and suddenly the game shifts into an oppressive mood. What causes this oppression? You’ll have to find out for yourself. But in a game about flowers, you can probably guess what the antithesis of nature is. This shocking shift is handled surprisingly well, and Flower manages to set off a feeling of grit and horror without ever bludgeoning another man and dropping a quart of blood. Something most games can’t fathom.  The biggest surprise about Flower is actually the last level. I shan’t give away what happens, but there is an incredible feeling of empowerment. Moreso than driving the giant mech or gun turret with unlimited ammo at the end of a sequence of any given futuristic shooter, you feel like the most macho son of a bitch alive for unleashing a flowery wrath on the aforementioned enemy. Never before has flowers pumped so much testosterone into my system in what is perhaps the best open-for-interpretation ending to a game since…Braid?    All this flower business is more masculine than you may think.     You can make numerous arguments for what it all means. The first gut reaction any person will have is that Flower is about hippie environmentalism; burn down the city, be one with nature, run around naked and smoke weed all day. But that final moment in the game does not suggest any kind of pro-Gaia, anti-urbanism nonsense to me. Rather, there are a number of other, more welcoming messages that I walked away with. The power of imagination, the battle with a 9-to-5 existence, the struggle with drudgery, the value of nourishing your mind. Perhaps all cliché themes in books or . But Flower makes full use of its interactive medium to make an impact on the person holding the controller.  I would say that a few small bit and pieces keep Flower from being an all perfect game experience. You accelerate the wind by holding any button on the controller, and steer with the broken Sixaxis motion controls. It’s not that you need absolute precision to manipulate breeze, but I had the occasional moment where my Hand of God was fumbling by, trying to make sacred u-turns to activate a single flower. Also, by design, it’s not a very replayable game. You could hunt down every stray blossom and cabbage patch if you so desired, but once you’ve had your flower fill, you’ll probably let the game stew on your PS3 hard drive for all time. Now keep in mind, I would say the same about Portal and Bioshock, two alleged all-time greats. Even if you never want to play either again, you’ll hang on to the memories of the experience for a long time.  And it doesn’t have Batman in it.  But Flower is a game that every Playstation 3 owner should experience. Even if you elect to not experience it for yourself. After telling my former girlfriend from the   Final Fantasy 13 review about it, she was considerably impressed and had a higher opinion about this shameful video game hobby that I waste way too much time in. It’s only ten dollars, with memories that will last a long time. Flower is, arguably, the best game of 2009 to not have Batman in it.  4 ½ stars     ",

    "review_description": "Flower is what happens when a bunch of no-good hippies learn how to utilize the Playstation 3's power.☆ (out of five)For years, indie developers have tried to convince themselves -- and, by extension, others -- that conventions are a bad thing; that challenge and complexity -- the cornerstones of any mechanically outstanding video game -- are harmful; that the \"experience\" -- whatever that's supposed to mean -- is what's important (as if conventions, challenge and complexity aren't what have provided the very best video game experiences, and continue to do so!) Flower is, as I see it, the culmination of this process: a game almost completely free of all those things, and that everyone seems to love. So without further ado, let's take a look.In Flower, you are the wind. You accelerate by pressing any button except START, which pauses, and control your direction by tilting the Playstation 3 controller. You have one objective: collecting petals. You do this by flying onto flowers, making them bloom. Flowers come in different colours. Activate enough flowers of one colour, and either 1) new flowers of another colour appear, or 2) a new path opens up. The flowers aren't hidden (there are \"secret\" flowers, but you make them appear simply by collecting enough non-secret petals), and aside from a couple of stationary, easily avoidable obstacles -- that, even if you do bump into them,cannot kill you; they simply destroy the petals you've collected (which really doesn't matter, because they still count; you don't have to go back and re-collect them) -- that only appear on one of the game's six levels, there are no hazards. If Peggle and flOw are casual, Flower is ultra-casual (which is relaxing and pleasant in theory, but dull and tedious in practice) -- there is literally no way of losing, and the only thing required to succeed is a pair of eyes.Actually, that's not entirely true: you also need a whole lot of patience. The tilt controls are a tad imprecise, so you'll frequently find yourself missing a flower or three, and the rate at which the wind turns makes Leon of Resident Evil 4 seem like the most agile man in the world, making returning to pick them up a huge pain. It's especially annoying in one level, where there's a long path in which the wind -- not your wind, but another -- blows; going against the direction of said wind is practically impossible, so what you have to do if you miss a flower is fly up to a point at which the wind, which moves along the ground, no longer affects you, fly backwards, and then fly back down into the wind to try and collect the missed flower -- and pray to God that the shoddy controls don't let you down again. It's hard to see why the developers couldn't at least have included an option for analogue stick control -- the Sixaxis' imprecision in not exactly a secret, and they must have know that the problems I've been talking about would occur -- or, if they felt that the tilt controls were that integral, that vital a part of the experience, have left out that goddamned wind. It's not like it actually does something -- aside from pissing you off and wasting your time, that is.For all its failures, there is one area in which Flower undeniably succeeds: it's a beautiful, beautiful game. The lighting is superb, the use of colour better, and the way the grass sways in the wind almost uncannily lifelike. It's possibly the best-looking game the Playstation 3 has ever seen -- were I reviewing it as a technical showpiece, I would have given it a glowing five stars; 10/10; A+. Unfortunately, I'm not. I'm reviewing it as a game, and as a game, Flower is awful. The controls are horrible, the objectives boring (collectathon missions are bad enough when acting as filler in otherwise good games; how anyone could think an entire game based on the concept would work is beyond me) and the level design abysmal. But I guess that's all you can expect when a bunch of no-good hippies who blurt out brain-dead nonsense like \"our video game version of a poem\" (And keep in mind that they aren't talking about a specific poem. Imagine a comic book artist saying \"this is my comic version of a book\", or a painter saying \"this is my painting version of a movie\". They would be laughed at -- and so should these idiots!) learn how to utilize the Playstation 3's power.",

    "review_deck": "Flower is a game you should try",
    "review_description": "              The game is laughing at you for sitting in your house instead of being outside     While playing Flower, I frequently found myself wondering what I wanted to get out of playing a game. Was it frequently being amazed by huge set-pieces that allow me to crawl into the skin of every boy's favourite action heroes? That certainly seems what most developers think, and who can fault them for doing so? Flower, however, has a different goal. It aims to let the player relax. It also, though never explicitly stated, tries to sensibilise players to the environmental issues humanity faces. It's simple, lone gameplay mechanic and presentation made me wonder whether I should even call it a game in the traditional sense of the word. But after some deliberation, I've come to the conclusion that Flower is one of the greatest ideas to occur to a developer in a long time, and an idea that everybody should at least try.  In Flower, you play as the wind. Every level starts with you blowing open a single flower, and then taking one of its petals over to another flower. This will in turn release more petals, which will form a huge cluster right behind you as you progress further and further through the level. In order to move on, you need to fulfill certain objectives, which pretty much always take the form of blooming every flower of a particular brand in the level. This will activate windmills, cause earthquakes that'll tear open rock formations and above all, make the dark dreary landscape light and almost excessively colourful again.    If you don't think this is pretty, you have no heart     The first few levels (out of six) start out with no real premise at all other than that you must fly through flowers and make stuff grow. However, the latter half of the game sort of surprised me with its aesthetics, and it's here that the (sort of expected) commentary and global warming can be interpreted. It lifts the game up into a higher tier of quality, making it more than just a cheap diversion for you to test the range of colours your TV can display with.  The idyllic landscapes, along with the no-pressure game mechanics and a fantastic, dynamic soundtrack make Flower the appeasing game it is. What did detract from the uncompromising enjoyment for me was the control scheme. Pressing any button on the controller speeds you ahead as a gust of wind, and the turning is done through Six-Axis control. While it can be called one of the better and more logical uses of Sony's attempt at making motion control a thing on the PS3, that's really not saying much. I still found the whole thing to be cumbersome at times, and I was occasionally fighting the game in order to fly through that single flower that I somehow kept on missing again and again. It makes sense that you can't turn on a dime, but since the very goal of this game is to “just relax”, these minor annoyances can become temporary drawbacks for the game. However, when it does work, and you're flying full-speed through some of the best-looking grass ever programmed into a game, the game makes for some mighty fine joy. Every time you turn a corner, a new range of flora and colours will burst onto your screen.    It sort of speaks for itself     It's weird; Flower is the game that would suffer the least from a lower-end TV or monitor, but also the game to which a nice, big TV with full-on HDMI 1080p offers the most benefit. It completely lacks HUD elements or text. It's one big blob of colour, meadows, leaves and blue skies. But it's also one of the most beautiful blobs you've ever seen, and is definitely worth experiencing in its full glory. Going for a low price on the Playstation Network, Flower is a game you should at least try. It probably isn't for everyone, but it represents a different train of thought on the developer's part than other games. This age of digital distribution allows for experiments such as this game, and I can only be pleased about that. Paying a small amount of money and sitting through a quick download will grant you one of the finer experiments in gaming today, and one that I heartily recommend you check out. Once you've amassed a thousand petals behind you and make a quick 180 to see them all flying into your face, I think you'll see what I mean.  ",

    "review_deck": "Very Interesting, Although Disappointing Game",
    "review_description": "Today I noticed that I had $10 left on my PSN account. So I decided to pick up the indie hit from Thatgamecompany, Flower. Since it won many casual & downloadable game of the year awards back in 2009, I assumed it be a safe bet for my first PSN game. Flower is a very unique game, not fitting into any traditional genre in the medium. Much more of an expression of art then most games, both in the retail & downloadable space. The true equivalent of a “hipster” video game, ha. First I’d like to point out what this game does right.Presentation & Story-tellingThis game looks beautiful & does a very fine job at making you feel like your really in a spring meadow. The way the grass & flower pedals move in the wind is great. It also has an interesting menu in which you access the various levels by cursing over a flower & entering it’s dream. The approach to story-telling is also where this game shines. The game starts you out restoring color into the scenery of a beautiful field & then switches to small cut scenes in a dirty, grimy city. By the end of the game the two very different scenes have come together to make one amazing environment. About half way through, the game gets very dark. Your suddenly thrown into a very intense sequence that is very much foreign from what you experience in the first few levels. I don’t recall seeing a game do this well at telling a story with no dialogue since Limbo. Now for where the game missed.GameplayThe game builds on a simple idea of being an experience where you can immerse yourself & forget that your even playing a game. This is achieved by having simplistic gameplay where you control the wind flowing from one place to another picking up flower pedals which in turn changes the environment. My problem with this is that even with the solid controls of tilting your controller, having to work my way through each objective missing flowers & having to work my way back really takes away from the felling of surrealism your supposed to gain from this title. Lastly, this game is ridiculously short. You can complete a playthough in an hour easily. You’ll spend not much more time picking up all the trophy’s afterwards. Which some require you to not even play for a set amount of time. With all the work Thatgamestudio put into this game, one would think they would of wanted to put more content into this package. Especially since there are so many other downloadable games out there packing allot more bang for your 10 bucks. my short time with this game was enjoyable but very disappointing when it was all said & done.I see why people like this game, but it's just not for me.",

    "review_description": "It is difficult to believe that there may still be a PS3 owner, or a gamer out there who hasn’t yet heard of thatgamecompany’s Flower. The game was showered with awards and recognition since its release in 2008, most recently winning a  award for Artistic Achievement in 2010. It is also one of my personal favorites and one of these games I’d recommend to anyone without any second thoughts.Much like other titles of the studio, Flower is an unusual title, often categorized as ambient gaming experience. It is a genre I have been very fond of for quite a while – an interactive entertainment type where player’s immersion and emotions take precedence over the score, reflexes or button mashing. It is a game that lets you relax and enjoy yourself in front of the console – a commodity much valued at the end of a busy day.The game places the player in the role of the wind guiding the flower petals through the meadows. Passing by the flowers spread around the environment makes them blossom and give away a spare petal to the player-controlled group, creating ever-growing vortex of colors and shapes. Blossoming all the right flowers opens up further areas for exploration and unlocks hidden secrets.There is no score, no The controls couldn’t possibly be simpler. Using Playstation Sixaxis motion recognition, the player can tilt and turn the controller to direct the wind. All the buttons serve exactly the same purpose – pressing any of them creates stronger breeze, allowing quicker movement. (Personally I found the L2 and R2 buttons to work best, since they permit a better pressure controls than ones on the face of the controller.)Executing more complex maneuvers such as tight turns and quick velocity changes may appear challenging at first, but within minutes anyone should be able to master the controls and guide their flowers like a world-class pilot.Flowers, petals, simple controls, no score; at this point many core gamers may think “oh, it is one of these games for girls and noobs”. I was surprised to see how many hardcore players, normally grinding away in titles like Modern Warfare, Starcraft or Counter-Strike got glued to the sofa with this game. It is really difficult to put away and often a simple “let me show you this little game” resulted in my friends playing through the entire length of the game in one sitting (and that includes a beautiful, interactive credits sequence).I did not mind though. Watching someone else play Flower is nearly as enjoyable as playing it yourself. It’s all thanks to the amazing visuals and the emotions Flower evokes in the player.Without spoiling too much of the story (yes, Flower does have a narrative skillfully woven into the six chapters) I can guarantee to anyone that you will be surprised, if not shocked by how much of an emotional roller-coaster this game becomes in the second half. It truly takes skill, craft and a lot of talent to make a player get so attached to what in fact is a bunch of polygons on the screen of a TV.“A bunch” though, could be a serious understatement. While I do not have the technical details on the game’s engine, at any given moment it is able to render thousands (perhaps millions) of blades of grass on the screen, all perfectly lit, animated and interactive. It’s hard not to marvel at the sheer technical achievement this game is – and the fact that the technology is put to a great use through the creative and art direction – only makes it better.Flower is that one-of-a-kind game – a title every Playstation 3 owner should see. It’s a game, it’s an experience, it’s a piece of interactive art. Even if flowers and nature are not really your kind of thing, I strongly recommend giving Flower a try. You may be surprised by how deep and enjoyable your experience will be.Maybe, even, when planning your next weekend you may end up deciding to go out of the city for a day and enjoy some time laying on the grass and staring at the sky.Flower: Trailer (click to play)Flower by thatgamecompany: http://thatgamecompany.com/games/flower/The game is available exclusively for Playstation 3 and can be purchased over the PSN.Flower is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.©2008 Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.Developed by thatgamecompany.This review was originally published on QubaHQ.",

    "review_description": "Costume  Quest is a delightful holiday themed RPG from Double Fine, the fine developers of Psychonauts and Brutal Legend. You start the game out getting ready to trick or treat with your twin sibling when all of a sudden your brother or sister gets kidnapped by monsters and its your job to rescue your twin.  You'll knock on doors, battle monsters in turn based battles, and gain new costumes as you progress through the story.  The game is graphically impressive for a download title, while roaming around the game may not technically look that impressive the cel-shaded graphics do the job well.  There's a great amount of attention to detail though, you can tell that the devs put a ton of work in creating the world and all of the Halloween decorations in it.  (there is one exception though which is a hedge maze section of the game)  The graphics during the battle sequences are quite different from the main game.  They are far more impressive on a technical level and watching each costumes abilities in combat is a blast, the animations are very good.  I found myself always looking forward to seeing what my new costume would do in combat.  The best is when you use the Statue of Liberty's special which flashes patriotic imagery on the screen with an eagle and Abe Lincoln. While you'll recruit 2 party members along the way to help you.  The costumes themselves however, are the real stars of this game.  There's quite a few of them and they are quite varied from vampires, to black cats to a french fry monster.  The way the costumes vary  on abilities  is very similar to a class system you might find in other RPGs.  Each costume only has one special ability and one normal attack but this can be augmented somewhat with the battle stamp system.  Each character can equip one battle stamp which will give different benefits like adding DOT's to your normal attacks, stun attacks, etc.  The one thing I would have loved for this game to have is voiceovers.  While the music is good and helps build the mood and the charm it's just a real shame Double Fine did not include voice overs.  I understand this is not a full budget game like Psychonauts or Brutal Legend but it still would have been nice to have.  While the game is catered to a younger audience there's still a decent amount of challenge to it.  You will die on boss fights if you take the wrong the combination of costumes into a battle or if you miss a few QTE's.  Some people might be turned off by the games length as it will probably only take most people about 6-7 hours to finish it.  I finished around that time and I also got all the costumes and did all the achievements.  As far as replay value, there pretty much is none unless you wanted to go through the main game again for fun. Overall Costume Quest is a charming, cute, great game.  If your willing to look past the games length and replay value you'll have a awesome time with the game.",

    "review_description": "      Double Fine,      Tim Shaffer's company behind the titles     Brütal Legend from 2009 and the overlooked classic    Psychonauts from 2005, brings us with Costume Quest a charming and adorable RPG for XBLM and PSN. It's perhaps not the longest or most memorable downloadable titles out there, but it's certainly a perfectly fine first entry by the developer for the downloadable scene. And while this isn't directly a Shaffer development, but rather Double Fine's lead animator   Tasha Harris project, it has that certain comedy and warm feeling we come to expect from Double Fine by now. You play as either of the twins Reynold or Wren, and the game kicks off with the other sibling being kidnapped by mysterious monsters that just can't get enough of candy. Of course your sibling decided to dress up as a giant candy during  halloween, and it's up to you, and two friendly kids from the block, to find and rescue your lost twin before it's too late. The nasty monsters are invading your local neighbourhood, mall and countryside to satisfy their sweet tooth, but luckily you have powerful costumes to switch into when it's time for battle.   A costume made of french fries you say? Humbug, I say giant spider!   The costumes, which serves as your \"equipment\" (for lack of a better RPG reference), come in different flavors, and range from knight to vampire (and ninja!). It's wacky and delightful to watch your characters switch into their respective role in battle. One minute you're out walking about, wearing nothing but a cardboard box claiming to be a knight in shiny armor, and the next moment when you encounter a monster you swing that sword and shield like you've done it all your life! You really have no idea if all of this is in the child's mind or not, but frankly you really don't care. It's all very clever made, and you quickly make it your personal goal to find and use every costume there is. The gameplay is very simplistic, and while the game is obviously aimed at a very young audience, it sometimes drags on a bit. There really isn't much more to it than running around, picking up very simplified quests, encounter a battle, and then enter a traditional \"attack > block > use superpower > win\"-fight. However the artstyle, storytelling, and pretty much everything surrounding all of this is so well made you quickly forget you're playing something juvenile. Hell, I'm 28 years old when I'm writing this, and I simply couldn't put the game away until I finished all of it.  Knights of the Cardboard Box Table     The length and replay value might be a wee bit disappointing, looking at the (currently) $15 pricetag. Finishing the story and all of the achievements took me around five hours of nonstop playing, but as I said those five hours were filled with smiles and feelings of a childhood almost forgotten by now. If you have younger children in your household I definatly recommend picking up Costume Quest, if not for the excellent story and artstyle, at least as a first attempt of introducing RPGs to the little ones.    (Apologies for bad spelling, as my native language isn't English)",

    "review_description": "Costume Quest is the ultimate childhood fantasy. The ideas of monsters being real and people transforming into vicious creatures are ones that most of us have probably entertained as children, and thanks to                  Double Fine and                 THQ, this whimsical fantasy is finally coming to fruition. Luckily, Costume Quest hits the perfect balance of intuitive game play and nostalgic subject matter to make for an excellent weekend of gaming for anyone who still holds a fondness for                Halloween deep in their heart.    Costumes Become The Real Thing During Battle   Siblings Wren and               Reynold love Halloween. Although they aren't quite as fond of each other, their parents stick them together for the night and send them off to trick-or-treat. You'll get to choose which of the two you'd rather control and promptly be rewarded with a sweet              robot costume, while the other sibling will be saddled with lame candy corn duds. Almost immediately things go awry and your other half is kidnapped by monsters, who have mistaken the candy corn costume for the real thing. Thus begins a grand adventure to drive back the candy-gobbling monsters, defeat the mysterious             witch who is helping them, and recover your sibling before the night is over. Although the adults are predictably blind to the monsters roaming the city, other children will offer their help in the forms of battle partners and item salesmen.   Upon entering a battle, you'll be treated to an awesome transformation sequence in which your character becomes a life size version of his or her costume. The transformation comes complete with all of the attacks appropriate of the costume, so robots will shoot missiles and space men will fire laser guns. Like            Penny Arcade Adventures before it, Costume Quest sports a relatively simple RPG-lite battle system. Each character has a basic attack which, when used several times in a row, will activate a more powerful attack. Attacking and blocking both require timed button presses and other little           mini games to complete, but the timing is always pretty forgiving. Although the game starts out quite easy, the difficulty does ramp up decently enough to keep things interesting. The game never does reach the point of being truly challenging, but it's still enough to keep you on your toes.     Fact: If You're Not Charmed By This Game, You Have No Soul    One of the main driving forces in the game isn't the battle system or the story, though, but rather the costume creation element. While the costume creator is completely linear in that you can only combine parts in specific ways, it's always fun to see the new threads in action during battle, and some of the skills are pretty funny. Further customization is offered in the form of battle stamps, little stickers which can be applied to costumes for added bonuses. One stamp might allow your character to          counter attack after a successful block, for example, while another will increase your character's         health. Naturally, these stamps can only be purchased with        candy, so it's in your best interest to whack every environmental protrusion you can find as most objects in the world will yield the sweet stuff when smacked.   Costume Quest is carried by a charming       cell shaded graphical style that fits perfectly with the subject matter. Characters and environments are crisp, bright, and brimming with personality. The costume transformations in particular look great. With all of the cute style that the game exudes, it's a shame that there's no      voice acting to back it up. Some of the scenes felt like they could have been improved with the addition of some cute-kid voice overs, pronouncing their R's like W's and generally being adorable. That could have pushed this game to     Kirby's Epic Yarn levels of saccharine. As it is though, the audio portion of the game is still strong thanks to a soundtrack that embodies the very essence of Halloween; it's whimsical, but with a mysterious edge.      When You Trick Or Treat At A House, You'll Be Greeted With Either A Monster Encounter Or An Unwitting Adult Handing Out Candy  Costume Quest is one of the strongest    XBLA/  PSN games of the year. At five to six hours in length, it's a bit of a breezy play, but it never feels like the game is artificially extending itself through filler. Every quest,  side quest, and battle has a purpose, whether it's to find new costume parts or to gain more experience points. Backed by a great presentation and a simple but fun battle system, this game will bring you back to the days when you were a kid haunting the darkened streets on Halloween. And that is perhaps Costume Quest's greatest asset: the sense of nostalgia that permeates every pixel has the power to make you feel like a kid again.",

    "review_description": "Costume Quest is a cute and charming little RPG from Double Fine, the creators of Psychonauts and Brutal Legend. It's not very long, but its gameplay and character make it fun and addictive like good RPGs should be.You play as one of two siblings, Wren or Reynold. It's Halloween night and they're getting ready to go trick-or-treating, but they have a bit of a fight like brothers and sisters tend to do. It turns out there are real monsters running amock in the neighborhood trying to steal and collect all the candy that they can. Your sibling, dressed as a candy corn is mistaken for a large piece of candy and kidnapped by the monsters. It's up to you to get them back, and along the way collect as much candy as your little hands can hold.      I have reliable intel on a house with full sized chocolate bars There are three different sections of the game, but each is structured in the same way. There're kids playing hide and seek who you have to find, a guy running an apple bobbing game, some kids looking for rare \"Creepy Treats\" cards, and a whole lot of candy to be found by hitting trash cans, piles of leaves and other things you'll see lying around. The main gameplay comes from when you trick-or-treat at the houses in the neighborhood. Depending on the house, you'll encounter an adult with candy or a monster ready to pounce you.When combat begins your cute little character changes in spectacular fashion to a badass looking fighting version of the costume they're wearing. Part of the fun of collecting new costumes is seeing just what shape they'll take in battle. The combat system isn't very complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it's quick and a lot of fun to play. The system is similar to the Penny Arcade game with turn based combat mixed with quick button prompts that vary slightly from costume to costume. One might be a slider bar where you have to press a button once it reaches the sweet spot, another has you mashing a randomly chosen button and another requires a quick button press after you attack. Once you get the hang of it, it's not at all challenging, but the randomization of the buttons keeps is interesting. The generous amount of rumble during attacks make it exciting and satisfying.   \"I want you to design the most badass looking box of french fries and.... GO!\" There are ten different costumes you can fight with, all of which have different special attacks. Special powers include AoE attacks, healing and defense abilities. Your abilities can also be modified with \"Battle stamps\" one of which can be equipped per person. Battle stamps are one of the collectibles which you either buy with candy from a friend's stamp stand or win them in battle. These give you abilities like higher HP, increased damage, counterattack, poison and stun effects. One thing I would've liked was if the game forced you to mix up your abilities. I played most of the game using counterattack and poison AoE stamps. There was only one that I remember needing to change up stamps before attempting a second time. Costume Quest has really great look to it, with a lot of thought put into creating this ultimate Halloween experience. A lot of it, especially the dialogue between the kids feels very natural and true to life. Things like how you can speed around the level on your healy sneakers really gives that sense of being a kid. The creators of this game really play into that childhood sense of nostalgia for Halloween.    Give meeeee candyyyyyyy!!! The game's dialogue is all done via text bubbles, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me at all. It's been a long time since I played a modern game that didn't have any voice acting, and it did strike me how silent it felt. But I understand that this is a small indie game, and paying voice actors was probably out of the question. It's a good thing that the writing is good. Not a lot of laugh out loud moments, but it's very clever dialogue that can give you a bit of a chuckle and make you smile.Near the end of the game I found myself wishing the game could've been made into a longer game with more features, because I would've loved to spend more time in the game. Some of the game got a little bit repetitive, and there were times I would've loved to have a world map, but the game is short enough that what repetition exists in the game isn't ever a deal breaker. In an ideal world I would've liked some more minigames, uses for the collectibles and also reason to change up my costumes and battle patches. My mainstays in the game were the robot, knight and I alternated the statue of liberty with a couple other costumes. More boss battles with specific weaknesses would've been great in a bigger game.     Just remember, you have to eat all the appls you bob, because one one else is gonna. Leveling up comes at a pretty good clip, and I never felt like I was grinding because the battles are very quick and a lot of fun. What can I say? It's just a lot of fun collecting lots of candy, occasionally getting a higher capacity bag and seeing what raw materials it takes to make the new costume pattern you've found. The game isn't very hard, and just by playing the game I got the full 200 achievement points with little difficulty. There were a couple costume elements that it took me a while to find, but the game is structures so that you can't miss anything if you happen to forget to collect something from a certain area and then moved on. I hope Costume Quest does well because it's a great fun little game with cute cartoony cel-shaded graphics and just enough gameplay variety to keep things interesting. I hope that Double Fine finds a way to revisit Costume Quest because I'd love to play more. It's out on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network for $15 so check it out!     ",

    "review_description": " Think back when you were a young child on Halloween. Innocent and bright eyed, with imagination flowing from you’re gray matter like a uncontrollable waterfall, churning all kinds of thoughts of fear and excitement from the creeps and critters that “haunt” the streets at night on your endless quest for candy and other confectionary treats. You’re costumes, be it homemade or store bought, became the uniforms of the journey.This is the feeling that is present in Double Fine’s “Costume Quest,” an XLBA and PSN title that oozes charm and whimsical wonder in a simple RPG candy shell. The debut project of Tasha Harris of Double Fine, with Tim Shafer serving as a support role, puts you in the role of either Wren or Reynold, twin siblings who just moved into a new town around Halloween, and you embark on a forced co-op candy collection by your parents. Very quickly things go south when one of the siblings (depending on who you choose to be the main character in the games beginning) is kidnapped by goblin-like minions because of her candy-corn costume. As it turns out, these monsters are attempting to snatch up all the candy in the town for themselves. It is up to the remaining sibling, along with two fellow recruited children, to scavenge the town and take down the candy-collecting creeps. The premise and plot is short and simple, and the typical off kilter wit of many Double Fine productions shines through thanks in part to the dialogue. The characters all have a personality, even the evil minions have some of the best lines in the game. There are plenty of moments where you can’t help but chuckle at the games charm. The game has you trick or treating in three sections of the town,  collecting candy and fighting enemies as you go. The games simple RPG elements consist of the most awesome battle animations of the kids transforming into the very costumes they wear. Be it a Robot straight out of mech warrior, a light-saber wielding starman, or even the statue of liberty, the eleven collectible costumes in the game each come with unique animations, attacks and special moves, be it healing the party, stunning enemies, or causing massive damage. And frankly, most of the joy in playing the game is to see what costumes you can collect and try on next when combat begins.Combat works primarily on quick time events. Each of the costumes uses a variety of these events, pressing the four main buttons at specific times or within a time limit, or even rapidly tapping the buttons for the same effect. The combat is very reminiscent of “Super Mario RPG” in that regard, making it easy to play and enjoyable for the games rather short duration. To add to the affects of your attack there are a number of purchasable stamps that can augment abilities, such as higher health or damage, or even splash attacks and stun moves. Your hard earned candy pays for these stamps too, so saving up to buy stamps is another reason to continue the quest to save your sibling.The game does suffer from repetition though. The same side-quests are pretty much found in the games three levels, be it bobbing for apples or trading gross out cards with other kids for experience. You know, kids stuff that does happen on Halloween. It is kind of annoying to see the same type of side quests in every area with the same goals in mind each time. The game also has really no difficulty to it. You always will attack first against the monsters, pretty much reserving only minor strategies against the games four bosses. The battles often end quickly so the monotony doesn’t last that long at the very least, making the game enjoyable in it’s simplicity.The graphics are pure sugary sweetness, cute and cuddly cel-shaded greatness that fit’s the whimsical world that was created. The battle animations are also pretty damn amazing, and easily the highlight of the entire game besides the story. The sound is well done, with a simple, somewhat spooky background music looping for both the worlds and the battle animations. There is no voice dialogue in the game, but the game doesn’t really need it either, instead using comic book text boxes that fits into the games aesthetic rather well. So the story is lighthearted and the gameplay is repetitive, and the six hour game does drag when dealing with the side-quests. I have seen other reviewers complain about these points, but for me, it fit’s the game well. The games charm and wit, combined with the simple gameplay mechanics give it an amazing premise and an enjoyable downloadable title. So if you have the $15 bucks to spare, pick up the game and relive your childhood fantasies this Halloween.Final Score- B+",

    "review_description": "If the picture above does nothing for you, then gladly, skip this post. I'm about to get ya'll \"knowledged\" up on some downloadable Clothing Party shenanigans.This is Costume Quest, from Double Fine, where you get to have the full Halloween experience. Like smashing pumpkins? Its in there. What about actually trick-or-treating? Yup, in there too. Alright, how about this; you like going door to door, or even walking around your cul-de-sac, looking for candy and then you get ambushed by monsters stealing the said candy, whereas such event to happen, you go into \"battle mode\" in which the costume you chose to wear out that night has magically became the item it is representing? THEN YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT!(Jason made a punny.) Costume Quest has all those and then some, all wrapped up in a $15 5 hour game. It's just awesome.You start out your Quest where you, the player, chooses between one of the new to town twin siblings, Reynold or Wren. The other child is then used as bait for the whole game, meaning after you two set out on your night, the first house you go to is invaded by MONSTERS! MONSTERS WHO ARE THERE TO TAKE ALL THE CANDY, EVERYWHERE! You being in your Robot costume and your brother/sister in their Candy Corn costume are both taken by surprise and eventually grabbed to be part of the haul.With your twin in the monsters' clutches, you set off gathering candy(currency) XP, party members, costumes, and battle stamps(stat buffs). The costumes you gather all demand either blueprints, or are just thrown at you with specific qualities and actions from/for quest completion. The candy plays only as a \"collectible\" in the shortest meaning, and is extremely addicting to scourge the landscape to get(isn't that true in real life too?). For the party members, Everette is introduced in the first stage while Lucy is the last one to join, in the second. They too share the unique ability to use the costumes to battle and serve to the \"RPG-ness\" of the game.That's right! That shit is REAL! Screen cap of a later battle I was in with my crew.Each character has HP, AP, a level, costume specific abilities in both special attacks and basic attacks, and the battle stamps to take on the opposing forces. Reynold(me) is in the French Fry costume, Everette(middle) is in the Ninja, and Lucy(right) is in the Robot. We each take the personas of the costumes and the outcome is usually something to behold. There are about 15 or so you can collect, but you don't necessarily need all of them to finish the game and save your twin.This is the \"Last Gourdian\" costume in a concept picture. Can't tell its my favorite or anything, right?Of course with the different costumes, there are many effects the costumes come with, like jet skates, a flash light, the ability to go invisible, or attract hungry NPCs. They are all used in one point of the game to further it along, but I found it most fun to just roll around fast-travelling with the skates.Now, onto the flaws little they be, but are still noticeable. As I first pointed out, its only about 5 hours of gameplay. The level cap is set at 10 with no real point to it; I finished the game at Lv. 8 or 9 and got through it fine. I later came back and farmed until Lv. 10 just because I'm OCD like that. The combat gets repetitive, the frame rate hitches for only a 1 gig download. Characters chug during battle sequences, alongside with just pop in and out of the environment. But the most annoying for me was that I've had to go around in a circle, after skating up a flight of stairs, five times to have my party actually get summoned back to my side, and there shouldn't be any big clipping issues like that.Anyway, the hours I put in was well worth the excitement I got out of this tiny package. The Double Fine team has done another great job in storytelling, gameplay even if it is nothing but a \"my first RPG\", and of course the writing itself. Those people are just plain funny. On my somewhat biased scale: 4 out of 5.",

    "review_description": " October 31 marks the true end of summer, called “Samhain” by ancient Celtic tribes, and is also the day when a doorway is supposedly thrown wide between the spirit and physical worlds. As is typical with ancient holidays, modern Western culture has buried the old traditions under piles of brightly colored packaging and commercial excess. But I’m not complaining. Any excuse to wear my Superman/Indiana Jones/Jedi costumes is cause for celebration in my opinion.  And to help you get in the spirit of things as well, I’ve decided to do a review of a downloadable Halloween-themed game called Costume Quest. This game appeared quietly on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace earlier this week for the price of $14.99 or 1200 MS Points, courtesy of Tim Schafer’s development studio, Double Fine.    Costume Quest introduces itself through a suburban family—two parents, two children—preparing for Halloween night. You can choose to play as one of two twins, Wren and Reynold. Immediately Costume Quest lets you know that it wants to be cute and funny with the comical relationship between the twin siblings and its simple, cartoony art style. And like most of Tim Schafer’s games it is truly funny. After my wife had seen about five minutes of this game she sat down on the couch and directed me to go talk to as many characters as I could find because she thought the dialogue was so funny.   And it’s a good thing the dialogue is entertaining, because there is a great deal of it. In the opening scene, Wren and Reynold bicker about whose costume is worse—I chose to play as Wren, meaning she got a rocking robot costume and Reynold was stuck with a lame candy-corn costume. All dialogue is displayed in speech bubbles rather than spoken aloud, which fits the comic book/cartoon aesthetic.   Reynold’s costume soon draws the attention of monsters called Trowbogs who are ransacking the neighborhood for as much candy as they can get. They kidnap Reynold, thinking he is the biggest piece of candy they’ve ever seen, and retreat behind a locked gate that will not be unlocked until all the houses in the neighborhood have been liberated of their candy. It’s a ridiculous and flimsy setup for the game to follow, but the game knows it and never takes itself seriously.   Wren plops down on the ground in semi-despair after her brother is kidnapped, and right away an inquisitive black cat comes up to her. Obviously this is a plot point, and a lesser writer may have gone for a mildly humorous Lassie reference—“What is it, girl?”—but this is Tim Schafer we’re talking about. Wren looks up glumly and says, “Great, now this weird cat is going to barf on me.” It was at this point in the demo that I decided to buy the full game.   Playing Costume Quest boils down to three mechanics: exploration, loot collection, and simple combat. There are three large levels in which you must knock on every door to reveal an adult with candy or a monster battle. If a monster greets you, Wren’s robot suit suddenly becomes that of fifty-foot mech, and the other ten or so costumes you can unlock have similarly impressive transformations. Battles depend on timed button presses and a good deal of strategy, especially in the second and third levels when you have a full party of three characters. But combat is still the weakest portion of the game.   Exploration is much more interesting and also depends on your costumes. The shoes of the robot costume, for example, have heelies that let you traverse a level quickly; the knight costume has a shield effect that deflects water and allows you to crawl into sewer tunnels without getting your costumes wet; the space warrior has a glowing sword to light dark areas…you get the point. As simple as it sounds, you will still have to use your brain to find everything there is to find in the game. There are costume patterns and components, battle stamps that “buff” your characters in combat, and bizarre candy cards with names like Sour Feet, Gummy Water, and Sweet Fat that other kids will want to trade with you.   Costume Quest is a short game at a budget price, and it never overstays its welcome. Each level looks quite different than the others and will take about an hour and a half to yield all its secrets. If the game were an hour longer, it may have felt a touch long, and two hours longer would feel like a drag. At five hours, it’s snappy and ultimately harmless. So if you don’t mind spending $15 on five hours of well-written, light-hearted entertainment, or if you just want to get into the Halloween spirit the way you did when you were a kid, give Costume Quest a try.",

    "review_description": "I played through Costume Quest last night in one sitting, 6 hours straight. I think that is the mark of a good game. The game mechanics got pretty repetitive after awhile and started reminding me of Assassin's Creed; trick or treat at house, trade card, get costume materials, fight boss, rinse and repeat. With that said the pacing of the story and unlocks was what held me on. Even if it meant trick or treating at 16/16 houses to progress and get that next \"cooooool\" costume moment, it was worth it. I think this game had some more difficult parts but was developed with kids in mind. It's a lot like Toy Story, there is a bunch there for us adults to have fun with, but the core demographic is probably a 8-12 yr old audience. My wife and daughter loved it and it's really a fun game to get you feeling like a kid again around the Halloween holiday. I think it's more worth 10 dollars, so maybe wait till it drops.  P.S. there are pumpkin pale and pumpkin mask avatar awards!!  Have Fun, Happy Halloween  -Construc",

    "review_description": "           The game is a pretty typical RPG style game that takes place on Halloween Night.  Yes, ladies and gents, this whole game takes place in one night.  You go from sleepy suburbs to a Mall to a even sleepier little farming town.  The game does a REALLY good job of transition from one area to the next while allowing you to go back and get any quests or items you might have missed the first time.  This game is all about collection.  Collecting candy, cards, costumes, quests etc..  If you don’t like collecting stuff this game is not going to be for you.          The thing I really loved about Costume Quest was the costumes.  In a game about Halloween what else would make it great?  Being able to change into any of the totally awesome and wonderful forms just by changing costumes makes this game wonderful.  The combat is simplistic but totally fun.  Who knew that real time turn based RPGs could be so much fun.   I completed the whole game with every achievement in around six hours.  But I did grind a fair amount and I did reach max level which is ten.  I know six hours isn’t very long but the game only suffers from it’s limit in that the game IS SO GOOD you don’t want it to end.       While the game is left open at the end for a sequel; I get the impression that it might be in poor taste to look for one.  This project certainly shows Double Fine’s talent for making a good, compelling, funny game.  Perhaps such a limited scope is what they do best.  I loved Costume Quest and everyone who loves a good collection based RPG should check it out.  Especially before Halloween, after that, I think the magic might have worn off.",

    "review_description": " Adorable.     There’s something to be said on what affect cuteness can have on one’s judgment, or on a person’s ability to see past the adorable outer layer – covered in glittered cardboard and face-paint – and look at what really makes something tick. But in the special case of Double Fine’s new Halloween-centric RPG, Costume Quest, I think charm actually outweighs substance. Big-eyed, unabashedly charming characters and wonderful storytelling provide a needed reprieve from an all too unnecessary need for repetition.     Set over the events of Halloween night, you play as one of a pair of twins – either Wren or Reynold depending on your gender preference – and go door to door trick-or-treating to your heart’s content. But events take a turn for the worse when monsters consumed by a need for delicious sweets kidnap your candy corned costumed twin, begging you to find a way to rescue him/her while still building a successful Halloween stash.  As odd and whimsical as that sounds, the writing in Costume Quest is superb. There’s a youthful innocence in some of the dialogue that plays well with the game’s tone, as well as some more mature or out-of-place jokes and references that appeal to the older crowd. Not much can be said about the character’s voice acting, as there are no voiced characters in the game. This might be construed as one of the Costume Quest’s faults, but I personally have no issue with it. My complaint would be the speed at which the text scrolls, and the lack of control you have over the text. In some cases, you’re given a prompt to continue to the next text bubble, but then there are other times where no prompt is given, and on occasion the text scrolls too fast to adequately read. Now, I don’t think of myself as a slow reader, but there were points where I would be distracted by something not related to the game and then miss an entire section of dialogue.    Being a game titled Costume Quest, one would think your choice of costume would affect gameplay, and this notion holds true. Each costume has a basic attack and a special move – which becomes available after a few turns – and modifies each character’s health and attack power. Finding the right mix of costumes for your party is key, as each costume has a different special ability, some involving attack and some centered more on support. As for the actual gameplay in Costume Quest, I believe it is most akin to turn-based RPG’s like the Persona series (more explicitly, Persona 3 & 4) or, to go way back in time, Earthbound, mixed with context sensitive battle mechanics found most recently in games like the Mario & Luigi series on the Nintendo DS. Outside of the door-to-door fights/trick-or-treating that takes place, most monsters in an area can be hit from behind to deliver a surprise attack, which inflicts damage at the beginning of the battle.   You'll be seeing this quite a bit.   Once you engage in these turn-based struggles, attacks are delivered via button presses or “stick-waggling”, where the timing of those actions affect the damage enemies receive. Defending from an attack acts under the principle, allowing you to mitigate some of the damage to your party. While these mechanics are implemented well, there’s not much variety from one battle to the next. Excluding boss characters, every altercation with a group of monsters will tend to play out the same way. Battle stamps, which act as health/damage modifiers or grant the use of extra abilities – dodge, stun, poison attacks, etc – help to alleviate some of the repetition, but the grind can still be a bit too tiring.     Some quests are recycled as well; in each area the same apple bobbing and “hide ‘n seek” quests would appear, along with some kids wanting you to trade candy-cards with them. I still don’t know what use those cards have, other than the achievement/trophy attached to collecting all of them.  Thankfully, Costume Quest is a bit on the short side, lasting me about five hours or so. Price vs. value judgments aside, I think this is an acceptable length for a downloadable title given how wearing and repetitive the combat can become. Fortunately, excellent writing and the lovable charm in its setting and characters help to keep the game fresh and interesting. Costume Quest carries itself on the idea, if not on the execution, and for that I give it my recommendation. ",

    "review_description": "Halloween is a great theme for storytelling.  Of all the holidays, it's the most mystical, mysterious, and dangerous while remaining accessible to children.  Costume Quest uses the Halloween themes to its advantage and crafts a delightful story of a child searching for his or her lost sibling.  Helped by a lot of  fantastic writing, CQ ends up as an entry-level RPG that I think just about anybody could enjoy.The characters and dialog of Costume Quest are what make it unique.      Costume Quest's biggest draw is not necessarily the story, but rather the writing and dialog between characters.  Double Fine is well known for making humorous titles and CQ delivers just that.  It's typically believed that humor in games is very difficult to pull off, but CQ pulls it off while making it seem effortless.  Unfortunately, the game contains no voice acting.  The writing can easily carry the story on its own, but without any real voice behind the characters, moments of the game can feel a little empty.  That said, the wit and humor in Costume Quest's dialog give the game a lot of life and lightheartedness that helps the title stand out.  Tell me about it...     Because the dialog is so strong, it becomes the biggest motivator for continuing through the game.  In this sense, CQ has moments that make it feel like an adventure game.  The game plays best when encountering a new character, exploring a new venue, or tasking the player with a quest such as finding a fellow trick-or-treator a trading card.  The best parts of Costume Quest are likely all the moments outside of battle.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of battling in Costume Quest and it tends to slow down the flow of the game.  In each zone you arrive at, you'll need to trick-or-treat at every doorstep in town before advancing.  Sometimes they'll have humans who will give you candy, and other times it'll be a monster bent on stealing your candy.  This forces the player into a lot of battle scenarios that are sometimes unwelcome.   Imagination is a powerful weapon.     The battle mechanics are sound, but ultimately unexciting.  After a while, the fighting starts to feel very stale and more like a chore than an enjoyable addition to the game.  The battles make use of timed button presses and active participation in the turn based combat much like the Mario RPG titles.  Near the end of the game, however, I was just wishing I could choose my attacks and watch them go.  The participation in the battle beyond the selection phase doesn't ultimately help make it more enjoyable.  The battles are mediocre at best, but they tend to feel more bothersome since the rest of the game and its adventure elements are so much more enjoyable. Costume Quest is a great game, well worth the experience even though it contains some flaws.  The comedy is clever, and sure to leave a smile on your face as you continue on your quest.  The battling can be a little tedious at times, but I think this is an easy game to put down for a while and come back to after you're ready for some more fighting.  A lot of people may feel the game is too short, but I enjoyed my journey enough that it didn't really bother me.  Costume Quest is a relatively short, fun adventure that has a lot of charm, wit, and appeal to any generation.    ",

    "review_description": " Costume Quest is one of those games that gives a good first impression. It has a nicely defined, clean art style, reminiscient of Animal Crossing or Earthbound, a whimsical sense of humour and simple game mechanics. The main thrusts of the game are mild adventure style item hunts and RPG battling. In order to proceed further and rescue your sibling from the clutches of the monsters hell-bent on stealing candy from your town, you need to acquire new costumes. Many of them have abilities that can help you proceed, whether it's an actual skill that affects the environment or simply a character that wants to see you clad in a particular getup (fetishists, probably).Battles take place in an alternate area, in typical JRPG fashion. Once there, however, your characters transform into what they imagine their costumes to be. It's arguably the game's greatest strength, as finding the components to a new costume and then entering a battle to see what sort of real-world creature it turns into never gets old.The battles are all turn-based, and you can attack or use special abilities (all of which take three turns to charge). There are timed button presses on each attack for increasing damage, and for negating some of the damage taken from enemies when it's their turn. Special abilities range from healing and defense to stuns and area of effect attacks. Unfortunately, many of them are repeated from costume to costume, making some costumes unique only in physical appearance and not abilities.None of this is particularly difficult, however. The item hunts simply require you to carefully wander around each of the three main environments, cards are earned by defeating enemies, candy is earned by whacking objects and trick or treating (many battles are engaged this way as well), and battle stamps are purchased from a creepy Peanuts' Lucy lookalike.By the end of this roughly five hour experience, you'll have experienced pretty much everything it has to offer, and unfortunately, the game provides absolutely no incentive to replay it as every collectable and every achievement can be (easily) earned the first time through. The story is amusing but other than one or two moments it's never laugh out loud funny (props to a fantastic Arrested Development reference, though), and the battles are essentially the same thing over and over again until you hit the final boss. There are probably too many battles for the game's own good, as it's the adventuring stuff that's a bit more compelling. But even there it's very light fare and not particularly substantial.It comes as a bit of a constrast to Double Fine's previous games, which featured fantastic characters and story but middling gameplay; Costume Quest lacks most of the former and unfortunately inherits most of the latter. But it's charming enough you won't really notice until after you've finished.",

    "review_description": "Costume Quest is the latest creation from developer Double Fine, makers of Psychonauts and  Brütal Legend. This adventure RPG is the first in a planned series of upcoming downloadable titles for XboxLive Arcade and Playstation Network as the studio shifts its focus toward smaller games with smaller budgets in lieu of disc-based retail outings. Set amidst the haunting glow of jack-o-lanterns on Halloween night, Costume Quest begins as brother and sister, Reynold & Wren, embark on their annual trip ‘round the neighborhood collecting candy. Things quickly go awry as one of the siblings (depending on who you choose to play as) is kidnapped by a pack of candy-coveting monsters. Costume Quest relies on Double Fine’s quick wit and a charming sense of humor as sweet as the treats those monsters so desperately seek. An easy but rewarding combat system keeps the action moving while side quests and the occasional bout of exploring are, for the most part, a fun addition.As you journey through the neighborhood, you’ll encounter fellow trick-or-treaters to join your cause as you rid the town of enemies and liberate homes of their sugary morsels. Knocking on a door will bring either a costumed adult with a witty line and a bowl full of candy (the game’s all-too appropriate currency) or a battle-ready monster.Battles are a mix of turn-based combat with an active twist. Similar to the combat of the Paper Mario series, Costume Quest’s battles are handled by selecting between normal and special attacks, the latter needing to be charged up before use, and applying it to your enemy. Time-sensitive prompts increase the damage you can inflict as well as increase your defense.Costumes play a large role in combat as the outfit you’re wearing changes your abilities. What may appear as nothing more than a cardboard robot costume becomes a gigantic mech that towers over the city, delivering missile blasts to any Grubbin foolish enough to stand in your way. Other costumes include a knight, perfect for shielding you from attacks, the Statue of Liberty, a healing class, and many more which you discover over the course of the adventure. In addition, Battle Stamps increase the options available to players creating a little more variety and depth.Along your travels, you’ll come across Sadie, an enterprising grade-schooler. (Think Lucy’s psychiatry stand in Peanuts.) In exchange for candy, she’ll give you Battle Stamps which alter abilities such as inflicting poison and put a few new tricks up your sleeve during combat like hitting an enemy after a successful dodge.The combat is a lot of fun although it can get very easy. As an RPG-novice I was surprised by what little challenge the combat presented. It would have been nice to see a higher difficulty curve but, as it stands, Costume Quest doesn’t offer much. If you’re looking for a game with punishing difficulty, go elsewhere, that’s clearly not the intention here. Still, what’s there is good and encourages experimentation. It’s not the most complex system ever devised but its fun while it lasts and at six hours the game ends before fighting feels repetitive.Side quests and exploring make up the time between battles as you trick-or-treat your way to the top. Bobbing for apples, card collecting, and playing hide & seek with the neighborhood kids are a fun addition to the overall experience however I was disappointed to see a lack of variety in these missions. In each of the three main areas to explore, you’ll find yourself doing the same thing in each level: bob for apples, find rare cards, find hiding children, repeat. The side quests seem to lack the same imagination that powers the game’s style and story.As the game nears its conclusion, certain problems arise. For starters, the game feels short and not because of some arbitrary limit on dollars spent versus hours played. What makes the game feel short is the rapid pace at which things wrap up. With only the three main areas to explore, you and your costumed cohorts reach the end just when things are starting to pick up. It would have been nice to see at least one more level. Still, in a way it’s a testament to the game that I was left wanting more. That feeling isn’t something you reserve for a game you dislike.Before the final credits, one of the characters declares, “We should do this every year!” and I have to agree. I can honestly see myself making Costume Quest an annual tradition this time of year. It’s not the longest nor the most-challenging game but what’s there is a fun, charming, and worthwhile adventure. The battle system is engaging and the game carries an imaginative spark that, simply put, makes me want to keep coming back.",

    "review_description": "      Typical exploration screen. In more than just its old-school RPG gameplay, Costume Quest aims to harken back to the good old days. Trick-or-treating is a childhood tradition closely adhered to by its participants, however archaic it may be, because of the delicious reward of earning something, much like the RPG's of old. As someone who's both put the practice behind them and sometimes takes care of two nephews, watching dewy-eyed children run amok on Halloween night was genuinely heartwarming. It felt like I was providing adult supervision to these kids on the craziest night of the year. And with actual monsters running around, stealing candy and abducting children on this particular year, perhaps it was the right choice to let me tag along. Earning candy is about more than just knocking on doors and saying the magic words, as goblins, trolls, and crows have randomly replaced the usual inhabitants, and you'll have to fight them using your costumes. It's a creative way to implement the classic random battle mechanic, since there are a limited number of houses, and every other encounter you can avoid or take on when you're ready to fight the bad guys. Fortunately, since real monsters are allowed, your costumes turning you into more fight-ready version of your caricatures also flies. Your party members can turn into giant robots, unicorns, French-fry spiders, and more as you collect new costume designs and find their components. Some also have abilities outside of battle, like letting you roller skate over ramps, see in dark, or walking through waterfalls or falling debris, which is about as close as the game comes to having solve something other than quests.       As long as you don't avoid too many battles, you'll have no trouble reaching the level cap. The battles themselves are turn-based with an element of timing thrown in to increase an attack's power or mitigate an opponent's strike. The battles also keep themselves engaging with some costume specific special attacks, quick-cut camera angles, and a higher-than-average difficulty – any regular encounter can end up killing you if you're not careful. Every battle demands your attention, and it's enough to keep the battles from become a means to end. And even if you lose, you're only dropped back out to the overworld to try the battle again, which helps quicken the pace of the game quite a bit. The ten-level cap, short quest structure, and Double Fine's signature humorous stylings also move things along quickly, making this an RPG with little filler. There were a few low points where I didn't know what to do or where to go, but they were only small hurdles. There are also a couple of presentation and interface issues, though those are pedantic issues at best. There aren't any astounding highs, but like Halloween, Costume Quest only needs to provide a single night of adventurous fun to make it worth the work (or cash, as the case may be). The reward here is some fast-paced RPG play and the story of, well, a Halloween special with a cute aesthetic. It's also likely the best way to relive your own memories of the fine art of begging strangers for candy.",

    "review_description": " As I was doling out candy to the assorted door-to-door treasure hunters  last Halloween, I began to wonder about today’s generation of costumed  kids. Do they go through the same dilemmas we did? Do they argue amongst  themselves on whether or not to “do both sides of the street”? Or get  upset when they draw the courage to visit the really creepy looking  house (with gravestones, scary music and a guy in the toy casket  surprising visitors) only to get lollipops in return? Do classmates  laugh at the guy who got the cheap-looking Ninja Turtles outfit? Costume  Quest purports to answer these questions and more, in a manner most  colourful. This is a semi-RPG that plays with the child’s spirit and  imagination on October 31st, with almost a Jerry Seinfeld-like attitude.  Because really, what is the deal with adults that give out raisins?   A couple of goblins, they were up to no good. Started making trouble in the neighborhood.         You  play as either a brother or sister, who’s trick-or-treating plans go  awry when your brother or sister are kidnapped by goblins. The goblins’  evil plans involve taking as much candy as physically possible, and your  brother or sister had the horrible misfortune of wearing a candy-corn  outfit. Thus, you will have to band together with other costume-clad  warrior kids from the neighborhood to stop these goblins from being  general jerks.So you’ll have to suit up and do battle in your  paper and tin can costumes. When you run into said goblin, your party  transforms into whatever they imagine their costumed personas to be. A  cardboard box robot becomes a fully-armed Gundam robot, a generic knight  becomes a Paladin warrior, a white unicorn becomes a rainbow-powered  majestic steed, and so forth. Part of the fun of this game is how it  takes the perspective of the kids’ imaginations. The robot will assume  all kinds of overdramatic poses. The Statue of Liberty’s healing attack  involves red and blue stripes, along with the pictures of a bald eagle  and Abe Lincoln’s face. The smartest decision in Costume Quest is that  it never discloses whether this entire elaborate adventure is the real  deal or just the children playing make-believe. One adult briefly  alludes to the goblins as “teenagers”, as who else would be terrorizing  the streets at night? But otherwise, they could be real goblins, or the  kids could have invented the whole shebang in their heads. Having that  semblance of doubt feels all the more curious.Otherwise, this is  a decidedly rudimentary RPG. Your combat options are restricted to a  basic attack, a special attack that loads up after two basic attacks,  and a possible third, equipped ability. The different costumes merely  dictate what your special attack is. You can use hard-earned candy to  purchase and equip badges that offer assorted stat changes. That is  about the extent of the game’s complexity. That the game’s level cap is  TEN should tell you that Costume Quest is suitable for a younger  audience. Anyone expecting Junctions or Gambits or any kind of crazy  customization system that makes no logical sense should stick to the  dozens of other RPGs that I can never figure it out.My one qualm  with a game that aims to keep it simple stupid is that it probably  shouldn’t be using phrases like “splash damage” or “DOT”. Lest we see  Costume Quest raise a fine generation of Warcraft addicts.   The kids retaliate with some Lancelot shit!     Everything  about the gameplay is kept equally as simple as the combat. Your  various side-quests include playing hide and seek and a  bobbing-for-apples mini game. Trick-or-Treating involves knocking on a  door and getting either a tacky adult who gives candy or a goblin that  makes you fight for your sugary prize. There aren’t any particular  brain-bending puzzles, and only the final boss will test your RPGing  merits. Despite the seemingly simple and redundant nature of the game, I  never quite found myself bored at any point. You consistently find new  costumes to ogle over, new areas to visit, and no shortage of cute  dialogue. While the game doesn’t have much in the way of “rolling on the  floor laughing my ass off” moments, there are plenty of good chuckles  and smirks to be had at the assorted bits of dialogue. And you’ll get to  wax nostalgic at your memories, like laughing at the kid with the  generic ghost-sheet outfit.It took me about 5-6 hours to finish  Costume Quest and nab all of the achievement; a reasonable length for a  downloadable title, to be sure. Odd as it sounds, this is not a game to  be playing for any kind of complex, difficult test of wit. But rather,  it’s more of a leisurely ride through memory lane and a chance to laugh  at the awkward thrill of the candy hunt. I would consider it worth  playing, and perhaps worth making an annual Halloween tradition. 4 stars ",

    "review_description": "  Costume Quest is kind of a trick-or-treat situation. The trick is that at it’s core, it’s little more than a stripped-down turn-based RPG in the same vein as any classic Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest. The treat is that this gameplay is wrapped up in a charming and funny package that can be appreciated by both families with young kids as well as seasoned gamers. Costume Quest represents the best of DoubleFine Productions: humourous writing in a charming package and engaging play mechanics that draw one into the experience. If Brütal Legend left you doubting the abilities of Tim Schafer and company, prepare to have your doubts pleasantly dismissed.  The premise of Costume Quest is something most people’s inner child can relate to: on Hallowe’en, you can become whatever crazy thing you may be dressed as. Empowered by their costumes, a group of kids battle against some very real monsters intent on cleaning out their neighbourhood’s candy and kidnapping the main character’s sibling. The overworld is filled with sidequests and random encounters disguised as trick-or-treating. There are three “worlds” to conquer and unfortunately, they all feature the same sidequests. I wish I didn’t have to play the same apple-bobbing game three times in each world; there are plenty of other Hallowe’en-ish activities that could have become minigames, like pumpkin carving. Still, the writing carries the more repetitive tasks and and makes the main quest a joy to play. I had some genuine chuckles reading the dialogue, which could have benefitted from player-controlled advancement rather than scrolling at its own pace. It was possible to miss some of the lines that moved at their own pace rather than waiting for a button press to advance.  When the characters enter combat, they literally become an embodiment of their costume. Imagine a ninja, the Statue of Liberty, and a monster made of french fries fighting a group of goblin mages, and you’ll get a pretty good mental picture of a typical Costume Quest combat. It plays like a standard turn-based console RPG, but it’s very streamlined. Characters have only two statistics: health and attack power. They each have a basic attack, plus a special attack that is unique to each to costume and charges every three turns. There are no complicated equipment screens or in-battle items like health potions. Characters are fully healed after each battle. The only consequence to losing a battle is failing to defeat the enemy and losing a bit of candy, the game’s currency. This may appear boring on paper, but in execution it works very well. Every battle action (like attacking and defending) is a quicktime event requiring different button presses to increase that action’s effectiveness. The battles become very engaging despite their simplicity. The combat gains a bit of depth from the battle stamp system, which modify character stats or give them new abilities to use in combat.  The game’s style is embodied by its graphics. Everything is bright and colourful, even when the game is dark and gloomy. The chibi-esque overworld character design plays a neat contrast to the awesome combat animations. On the PS3, the game did take some framerate dips in the overworld. It didn’t interfere with gameplay, but it was a mild annoyance.  The game took me roughly 10 hours to complete to 100%, and I earned all trophies on the first playthrough. There isn’t much incentive to replay the game, but I might give it another go next year when Hallowe’en rolls back around. On the whole, I was very glad to have purchased Costume Quest. It is definitely worth the $15 asking price.    ",

    "review_description": " Double  Fine, the people that brought us Psychonauts and Brutal  Legend, have  released their first downloadable title, Costume Quest.  This Halloween  themed RPG is dripping with adorable, but is there a  Tootsie Roll center  of this Tootsie Pop? Let’s find out. From  as soon as the title screen pops up, you know you are in for  some fun.  The trademark Double Fine style is all over the place. More  Psychonauts  than Brutal Legend, the characters have over-sized eyes and  exagerated  features. The colorful environments are full of charm and  whimsy. The  costumes are stars of the show and their design is great.  Even the menus and HUD are fun to see. Overall, this  game is a pleasure  to look at. From  a pure gameplay perspective, you are handed a real mixed bag.  The  exploration of the areas is generally brisk and leads to some  adventure  game lite quests. From finding fruit for a pie, to collecting  rare candy  for some of the other children, the quests are simple, but  cute.  Usually the reward for your exploring is finding a piece of a  costume.  Upon finding all three pieces of the costume, one of your  characters can  wear the costume in battle. The  battle system is the main problem with this game. It’s really  exciting  to watch the cardboard and tape costume creations transform  into a more  “realistic” version, but there is little depth or strategy  to using  them. Each costume has a basic attack or special ability that  charges up  during the battle that can be used about once every three  turns. These  special abilities are just about the only thing that  differentiates the  costumes. Characters can be slightly customized  using battle patches  which grant bonuses such as extra attack power,  stunning, or ongoing  poison damage. I ended up using the first three  costumes you come across  throughout most of the game, the robot, the  Statue of Liberty and the  Knight. The  battles end up being a repetitive series of button presses and  the  occasional joystick move. It’s a little bit of a let down that the   costumes are so fun to find and unlock, but the game really gives you  no  reward for having them. The game’s wit, charm and sense of humor try   really hard to make up for what it lacks in terms of gameplay, but it   doesn’t quite. Don’t get me wrong, I loved every second of it. Of   course, a lot of that had to do with the fact that my son loved playing   it with me. It’s just hard to, at $15, recommend this game to everyone.  Originally published  here.",

    "review_description": "                                                                                                                                                          Costume Quest Review Remember  when you were a kid on Halloween? You got to go out late at night, get  lots of candy, but more importantly, dress up in your favorite costume.  This is but the basis of Costume Quest, one of the best Halloween games  I’ve ever played. By the time you reach the end, you’ll be begging for  just one more area to trick or treat.  Story-  Costume Quest is about a pair of twins named Wren and Reynold, Wren  being a girl and Reynold being a boy. These twins are at each other’s  neck on who will be the leader this year for Halloween. While you get to  decide who you play as, Wren or Reynold, the overall story remains the  same throughout the game. Since they are new to the neighborhood, they  don’t know anybody in town and are left by themselves. You’re given a  Robot Costume while your sibling is given a horrible Candy Corn Costume.   The first house you go trick or treating at gives you nothing since  they just hate the Candy Corn Costume. Thus you stay behind at the next  house being afraid to be seen with your siblings’ horrible costume. It  just so happens the next house has been taken over by monsters and they  kidnap your sibling mistaking him/her for a giant piece of candy. Your  job is to rescue your brother/sister so you won’t get grounded by your  parents.  This is the overall premise of the game. You keep going deeper and  deeper into town, discovering a total of 2 locations other than your own  suburb to trick or treat at. You find new friends, meet new enemies and  create new costumes. If you just want to rush the main story, you’re  looking at roughly 3 hours of gameplay time. But if you’re like me, and  you like to collect all the extra’s, gain all the costumes, and find all  the hiding kids, you’re looking at a 5-6 hour game.        Gameplay-  Like any RPG, your set into 2 different modes, exploration and battle  mode. In exploration mode, the costumes you find give you special  abilities such as increasing speed, shielding rocks/water from above,  and lighting your way through dark areas. Also, you are given several  different quests to accomplish. These range from finding kids playing  hide and seek, beating all the bobbing for apple levels, trading special  trading cards with other trick or treaters, or going to every house  trick or treating. There’s a LOT to do, and each quest is different than  the last, with a lot of exploration. When visiting the areas of your  suburb you will encounter different kids that ally with you and join  your party, they help extremely in battle. When you go to any house and  trick or treat, you knock on the door and have a 50/50 chance of  encountering a regular person who gives you lots of candy, or you  encounter a monster. These monsters are stealing all the candy in your  town and definitely want yours. This is where Battle Mode begins.  In Battle Mode, your costumes you create take on a life of their own.  Your simple robot costumes becomes a high tech robot killing machine,  Your knight costume transforms into a valiant knight ready to do battle,  and so forth. Battles consist of turn based fighting style, like any  familiar RPG does. You have a basic attack, and a special attack that  needs to charge up. After every attack your special meter charges and  after roughly 2 turns, you’re ready to unleash it. These special  abilities range from devastating attacks, healing your allies, or  stunning your opponents. After every battle your health recharges to  full, so you don’t need to worry about healing items or anything like  that. Battles normally take around 2-3 minutes ranging from what kind of  monsters you’re faced with. These can be Monsters that just attack back  with clubs, mages that can do a lot of damage, and healers. You will  need a good strategy to take down these monsters, simply pressing X or A  will not cover it. For every attack you do, you’re given a button  prompt. Either press this specific button when a marker reaches a point,  rapidly press a button, or just press it when prompted. These can be  quite tricky if you’re not paying attention. This gives battles more  excitement as opposed to just pressing the same button over and over to  attack. Defending from enemies also has button prompts as well. Although  the battles are enjoyable at first, towards the end of the game they  tend to get a little repetitive.    After each battle you gain XP and Candy. XP gradually increasing till  you reach the next level, in which you level stats automatically. Candy  on the other hand can be used to purchase different enhancements towards  your costumes. In each town you encounter a “shop” that sells something  called “battle stamps”.  These battle stamps add special properties to  your costumes. Such as increasing your health, doing more critical  damage, or causing splash damage to all enemies. You can equip one  battle stamp to yourself as well as each of your companions.        Sound & Graphics -  The music to this game is incredibly well done.  Each area has its own  special theme that matches the design well. The battle music is really  good as well. It’s not too loopy and it’s not too long. As for sounds  that happen in the game, they are done pretty well also. Smashing  pumpkins sounds like….well smashing pumpkins. Many battle sounds are  repeated though which is a little disappointing. Having a couple more  variations instead of the same “smack” sound would have been a nice  touch.   I’m going to let you know right now that there is absolutely no voice  acting at all in this game. From start to finish, all conversations are  placed in text format. This isn’t so bad considering some jokes are best  told through text. But even on my HD 1080p TV, I had to squint my eyes  to actually read what they were saying. Words were definitely WAYYYY too  small. Upping the font size would be greatly appreciated. Textures  looks really well detailed although the characters remind me like their  models were based off Animal Crossing characters. Pumpkins glow, and the  lighting is done in such a way where dark places look extremely dark,  and street lights looks very illuminant. It’s hard to go into specifics  here since the game only has a few graphical areas such as the objects,  characters, and backgrounds, all of which look really well put together.    Presentation-  The game screams Halloween, from the title screen to the end credits;  you’ll definitely find it to be very Halloweeny. Which is a very good  thing, I’ve seen too many “Halloween games” go from Halloween to  something completely different halfway through. It’s a nice refresher to  see a game know what it’s doing, and doing it very well. There are nice  touches such as spider webs hanging from ceilings, to pumpkins  literally all over the place. Virtually everyone is wearing a costume,  and candy is dropped all over just waiting for you to pick it up.   If you love Halloween, this is definitely a game for you. They put so  much effort into making it look like Halloween, that by the time I  played it I actually THOUGHT it was Halloween. Although there are no  spooky houses to explore, there are some scary graveyards that just beg  to be explored. Every inch is covered in something that looks like a  Halloween decoration, and decorations you would expect to see are blown  completely out of proportion to be even cooler than they would  originally.        Final Thoughts-  Costume Quest isn’t a game that’s like Halloween, it’s a game that IS  Halloween. It’ll have the inner kid jumping for joy, and begging for  more candy .There are plenty to explore and plenty to see, and PLENTY of  battles to be had.  Double Fine certainly outdone themselves with this  game. Although there are shortcomings such as almost everything from  battles, to sound being repetitive, and being a little on the short side  while another area would have been nice. Costume Quest is pretty short,  but oh so sweet. With almost no tricks in sight, it’s a big wonderful  treat. There are really fun times to be had, and will be had once you  pass the title screen.

    "review_description": "Costume Quest may be the greatest thing to happen to video games in a long time. After all, what good is a medium of entertainment if you don't have seasonal stories. You start out as either Wren or Reynold and get dumped out into the neighborhood wearing a robot costume with your candy-corn-costume wearing sibling in tow. The sibling you are not controlling then gets kidnapped and taken to be eaten by an evil overlord of candy named \"Big Bones\". This, needless to say, means that you'll be trying to get your sibling back before he/she can be eaten by \"Big Bones\", oh I'm sorry so that you can trick-or-treat your face off. Along the way you'll meet an interesting cast of monsters, children, and adults that supply quests, experience, candy (the games currency), and humor in equal measure. Enter Costume Quest, the world's first trick-or-treating simulator. Okay, that's not entirely true but you will knock on doors and get candy. Where Costume Quest differs from your ever year, run-of-mill trick-or-treating is that sometimes monsters will answer the door instead of people. Monsters being the no good, thieving scum that they are, must be dealt with. How to deal with these threats? Just stick on a costume and turn into a robot. Or how about a Vampire? A robot unicorn? A black panther? Or how about my personal favorite, the french fry spider? Need I say any more about the charm and imagination of this game? Okay then,  a  very clever reference to The Chronicles of Narnia, a paranoid dude who sets up an apple-bobbing game in every area, an analogue to Garbage-Pail Kids, and fat jokes abound in this humorous game. Costume Quest's gameplay reminds me of Paper Mario in that the turn-based battles are reminiscent of a JRPG, but far simpler. In fact, the game basically is Paper Mario, but simplified to the point where it becomes inexplicable (and inexcusable) that there isn't any sort of co-op to speak of. This is, in fact, the only issue I can think of with the gameplay. As this game is very obviously aimed at children it is almost a sin that no co-op was put in this game. Otherwise, the game is easy and inoffensive, neither challenging nor encouraging the player to do anything more than the fifty some-odd quests, the thirty some-odd \"creepy treat cards\", and the twelve to thirteen costumes to collect.  Costume Quest's seasonal nature may work in its favor in the long run, but does it have the chops to earn your dollar now? I often wondered this while playing through this three or four hour game. Equally as often as I wondered whether or not this game was worth my money, I said yes. However, I think that answer is far too short to describe this short game. I will give this longer answer in the form of a candy metaphor. If you like to eat candy really fast then this game is not for you, however, if you're the kind of person who savors each piece of candy as if it was his last then yes you should buy this game. It won't last as long as some other sweets, but what it lacks in length it more than makes up for it in its sweetness and charm.",

    "review_description": "It's good to see people getting really excited for Halloween in video games. The kids in          Costume Quest feel like this is the most important holiday of them all. Even more important than some holiday that happens           near the end of the year. These kids really want to trick-or-treat right. And who wouldn't?          Double Fine brings us a charming and lovable adventure of a boy, or girl, on a quest to save their sibling from danger on Halloween night or face the wrath of being grounded. Monsters have invaded the your suburb to steal candy and it's up to you to stop them. It's a good thing you transform into giant awesome versions of what your costume is. It is literally how awesome kids think of themselves when they go trick-or-treating wrapped in tin foil.  Costume Quest is essentially an        RPG. A very simple one at that. It takes mechanics reminiscent of       Paper Mario or the      Super Star Saga, where you are engaged in mini button presses during the battle. You can score critical hits or even mitigate damage with successful timing. The costumes in part are inherent with varying abilities that are akin to classes in RPGs. A battle stamp system on top of this adds effects that may happen during battle, such as status ailments or added damage to attacks. They are very simple and easy to understand mechanics that many can easily pick up and learn with a few encounters.  It's not how the game plays that makes Costume Quest put a smile on my face but how it conveys Halloween through a very eager and willing child's eyes. The writing should be expected from Double Fine. With clever and funny writing that had me chuckling throughout the game. The passion that the kids portray really put me back to how awesome Halloween was when I was a kid. It makes the whole game feel genuine and thoughtful. Like it was really kids who came into the office and threw out ideas about \"How awesome would it be to turn into this giant spider made of out french fries?!\", or \"Have candy be like money!\".   One of the things that caught my eye was the lack of a hard save system. Auto saves do happen from time to time but I've only noticed that it was as I was changing locations in the world, which I later discovered towards the end of the game. The simplicity of the battle system left the battles toward the end of the game to feel draggy. If you blow through the game in one sitting then it's no problem but if you taking your time with it then you might come across some bumps. That isn't to say that the game is short. I went through it at roughly five hours after I defeated the final boss. For a $15 down loadable game it's a good amount of questing and gathering candy.   This game caught me by surprise at how much of a good package it was at the end of the day. If you don't mind simple game mechanics and a not quite there save system, you should be in for a treat. A candy treat that is! Dohoho. Double Fine has reinforced their ability to bring good writing and solid themes to video games. It'll be interesting to see what they will bring us next.",

    "review_description": "     As I played through the back-half of Double Fine’s latest, Costume Quest, the first in their new initiative to sell smaller, more focused titles, I couldn’t help but feel that Double Fine had finally found its place in the gaming world. For years now Double Fine has been at the forefront of blending humor, in the form of incredibly sharp writing, and imaginative worlds into games that were often lauded for their storytelling, but criticized for their gameplay. They’ve also been on many a list of “Games that didn’t sell well, but should have.”, which brings us to what I consider the perfect fit for the quirky game studio: Costume Quest. This downloadable title for XBLA and PSN does what their previous two games (Brütal Legend and Psychonauts) weren’t able to, which is to create a clever, well-thought out game that doesn’t fall under its own weight when it requires the player to actually play it.     Costume Quest’s premise is simple; you are a boy or girl on Halloween night ready to trick-or-treat with your younger sibling (Much to the chagrin of your character) when he or she is taken from you by a band of candy-stealing monsters, mistaking his or her Candy Corn costume for being a giant piece of actual Candy Corn. You then proceed to knock on doors, trick-or-treating your way through multiple levels to get her back, bringing other trick-or-treaters with you along the way. The original premise is not wasted on its gameplay fortunately. While Costume Quest is a somewhat simple turn-based RPG with basic timing-based button prompts, it features a fairly deep job system in the form of costumes.          Reality's version of Halloween; bummer...     Costumes are found throughout each of the game’s three different “neighborhoods”, each bestowing the player with different abilities in, and out of battle. For example, your starting robot costume has a special missile ability which damages all enemies on screen, but also features skates when outside of combat for you to zip around on or to jump off of ramps with. Another example of the game’s 9 or so costumes is the Knight, which features a shield ability, which blocks incoming attacks for a turn, and helps you walk under falling debris or water to get to hidden areas. Not all costumes are particularly useful, but for the most part their imaginative designs and fun special abilities provides a good carrot-on-a-stick for the player.        Further expanding upon its RPG roots is the fairly intricate Battle Stamp system. Throughout your adventures, you’ll come across the young entrepreneur Sadie, complete with lemonade stand (Ala Lucy from Peanuts), except instead of serving cool refreshments, she serves up special augmenting abilities in the form of collectible stamps. You can equip one of these stamps to each of your characters, and their abilities range from a simple counter-attack upon being hit to the “Egg on your Face”, stun ability, to the highly useful splash-damage stamp which also has a chance of poisoning those enemies. It’s a fairly intuitive system that encourages experimentation, both due to the number of stamp combinations in a party, but also because Costume Quest isn’t a very difficult game, and so your risk of a “bad” stamp combination is fairly minor.        These kids' version of Halloween; that's more like it!      The game’s difficulty was actually the only thing I found annoying while playing through its 3-4 hour campaign, as it ranges from fairly easy to mind-numbingly simple to pseudo auto-pilot. But of course, this complaint shouldn’t be much of a surprise; Costume Quest is clearly aimed at a younger audience than the 19-year old college student demographic, with its whimsical art style, its fairly simple game mechanics and the obvious Halloween theme itself. For me, these were all clearly intended as a precision airstrike on the pleasure centers in my brain, bringing back fond memories of dressing up as a child, in search for candy out on the cold streets of downtown Boise, ID.     But regardless of your childhood memories of the ween of Hallow, Costume Quest is, at its core, fun. Its writing is sharp in much the same way the writing in Peanuts is; it’s a fantastic looking game, with an imaginative art style that perfectly captures a child’s version of Halloween night. The music is also very good, replicating the fun and whimsy of Halloween in its main theme. If I had to complain about one aspect of its presentation, it’s that Costume Quest is an oddly silent game, mainly due to the total lack of VO. All of the dialogue in the game is presented in word bubble form and that’s about all you get. It would’ve been nice for all of the kids to at least talk in Legend of Zelda/Animal Crossing speak, or something similar along those lines. After about half an hour though, I quickly stopped noticing and had gotten used to its simplistic story presentation.         Oh Wren, if only you knew what fate would befell you, maybe you'd be more supportive.     In closing, your enjoyment of Costume Quest will more than likely depend on one of three things. Either you’re a young kid who loves Halloween and always fantasized about becoming the thing your costume represents, fending off hordes of monsters with your friends in search for more candy; you’re much older and remember the “good’ol days” of trick-or-treating in your neighborhood when the candy was “good”; or you’re just looking for a fairly low-key, tight game experience that’ll leave you with a warm feeling hours after putting the controller down. Double Fine has crafted an excellent title in Costume Quest, that doesn’t outstay its welcome, while bringing together some of the finest work the studio has ever created.",

    "review_description": "This little bit of self-indulgence was originally posted on my personal blog.  Check that out HERE if ya please.   What happened to Halloween? As a child, it was always one of my top holidays to look forward to, but at a certain age, there just isn't much to do with All Hallow's Eve anymore, that is at least nothing that really has to do with the spirit of it. You can certainly dress up and go to a party or go to one of those theme parks where people pay twice as much for a ticket in order to walk around for several hours and be startled repeatedly, but that's not what it was all about. No, Halloween used to be about BECOMING someone, about letting your imagination run free and living in someone else's shoes for one night.  More than that, you had a mission; GET CANDY. So think about this. You dress up for one night and inhabit an entirely different persona with all that persona's motivations and mannerisms PLUS having the overwhelming need to go to the houses of complete strangers and ask for candy. Putting it this way truly points out why it is that this is a holiday that can only be properly celebrated by children.        Then there's Costume Quest, a game which cleverly allows you to completely side-step this notion and again experience what it was like to be a kid on that night of nights. Through clever writing, simple gameplay, and the most awesome of premises, Costume Quest is a game that captures the fun and whimsy of the lost holiday.Costume Quest is the story of brother and sister twins Reynold and Wren. They've just moved to a new town and, barring some apprehension about being in an unfamiliar neighborhood, they're ready for their favorite holiday, Halloween. It's at this point that the player assumes control of one of the siblings, with the other sibling dressing as a giant piece of candy corn. This is important because shortly after embarking on their night's journey, the candy corn-ed sibling is abducted by one of many monsters who have invaded the town in an attempt to steal its candy. Luckily, Halloween is our hero's \"thing\" (and yes, that's all the explanation you get as to how their awesome powers work), and he/she is able to use one of a myriad of costumes to combat the invading menace. Joined by a noble trick-or-treater, Everett, and later a brainy wunderkind, Lucy, our hero must brave the town's landmarks, defeat monsters, and collect candy all in the name of saving their sibling. What really sells everything in Costume Quest is its writing and presentation. Double Fine (the game's developers) have built a career on making funny and insanely clever games, and this is no exception. From the reverence and nostalgia-inducing charm they place into our little trick-or-treaters, to the hilarious puns and references thrown in, I was smiling the entire time I was playing this game. It doesn't hurt that the art style is thoroughly adorable, and though it might not be the sharpest looking game, the visuals never detract from the experience. Top that off with a soundtrack of Halloween-inspired tunes, and the candy coating of Costume Quest is thoroughly delicious.       That presentation spills over into gameplay as when our little tykes engage their monstrous foes, they transform into what one can only assume is the true visage of what they think they look like in their respective costumes. Costume Quest is a turn-based RPG with a bit of the Mario and Luigi RPG games thrown in as well. Each character can wear any of the games brace of costumes and, combined with a number of stat-boosting \"battle stamps\", can take on specific roles in battle. For example, the Knight costume with a health-boosting battle stat becomes the team's immovable tank while giving the Statue of Liberty costume a stamp that induces poison turns that character into a major support player with healing and de-buffing power.You'll use these mechanics as you traverse three distinct areas in the town. This usually involves trick-or-treating or item collecting to oust monsters out of their hide-y holes in order to progress to the next part of the game. It becomes formulaic after a while and although some adventuring elements are present and a few side-activities, it's probably a good thing the game only lasts for about 6-8 hours.And that would be my one complaint with the game, that their just isn't enough. The variety of costumes keep the game fresh throughout, but adding an extra wrinkle to combat could have gone a long way to making battles feel less formulaic over the game's campaign. Similarly, another side-activity or two could have made each town feel unique, but sadly you'll be doing the same thing three times and then the game ends. Luckily, all this is a moot point because of the game's heart, charm, and presentation, but one can't help but think that there could be more game here.Regardless, Costume Quest is a game that reminds you why Halloween was great, and for a sentimental old softy like me, that's really all it had to be. Beyond that, it's a smartly written and funny game that isn't hard to get into and play, even if that fact becomes a bit of a hindrance towards the game's end. More than that, though, it's a game that anyone of any age could easily play year after year on Halloween and have just as good a time with it. That alone makes Costume Quest the sweetest thing I've played in months.Costume Quest gets 4 pumpkins out of 5.    ",

    "review_description": "Costume Quest is Double Fine's first foray into bite-sized gaming. It feels as though the developers took very tried-and-tested game mechanics, mixed them with a quaint but clichéd story and proceeded to dip the combination in a vat of charming, artistic goodness.   Yeah, it's pretty.      The first thing you notice as you begin the game is the art style.   Reminiscent of series such as Animal Crossing and the Penny Arcade, it features a somewhat “cartoonish” palette. The costumes worn by the game’s young protagonists appear simple and innocent at first. However, as soon as you enter a battle, those cute little costumes transform into menacing structures of death such as; an anime-style mech or a knight ripped straight from a children’s fairy-tale. This is very much a scenario of Halloween being seen through the eyes of a child for whom nothing is more utterly badass than the idea of his/her own costume. The gameplay on the other hand is not quite as imaginative. The exploration consists of basic traversal, which has a tendency to drag due to the painfully slow movement speed of characters, through one of three, admittedly large, locales while bashing everything in sight with your candy pail, in hopes of receiving a morsel of candy. You will engage in trick-or-treating from the get-go. Behind every door is either a friendly adult, handing out huge amounts of sugary goodness, or a bloodthirsty monster.   The combat is turn-based and requires timed button presses, movement of the left analog stick, repeated tapping of a certain button etc. for any individual attack you may wish to perform. All-in-all it is quite simple and quickly becomes repetitive. Jaded RPG enthusiasts beware, if you’re looking for a challenge, this isn’t it. Battles are all played out in an identical fashion, your party attacks, and then your enemy attacks. After three turns, you gain access to a special ability which varies depending on the costume you’re wearing. Wash, rinse and repeat. It should be noted that pretty much every encounter is nigh impossible to lose. The game has a tendency to hold your hand and never let go lest you do something devious like be creative.       Get used to this, you'll be seeing a lot of it.        Rewards for battle include, obligatory currency (in this case, candy), XP and collectable cards. These cards ultimately don’t mean anything but there is an achievement up for grabs if you manage to find them all. Sometimes, you might pick up a Battle Stamp after a fight. These stamps allow your characters to gain individual abilities that come in handy during battle. The effects can range from increased HP to a new combat ability. Candy is used to purchase further Battle Stamps outside of encounters. Costumes are interchangeable and grant the user varied and somewhat unique combat styles. Costume patterns and materials are found by completing quests and exploring the world. Most costumes have an ability which can be used outside of battle, such as the robot’s skates which allow you to traverse environments faster. Due to the fact that costume changes are reflected by your character model in battles, I often found myself eagerly seeking out the next costume purely to see how much exponentially cooler I looked. The area where the game truly shines however is in its writing. Every NPC has something charming or witty to say. Every aspect of the dialogue oozes a certain pizzazz which will have you reading all of the game’s text with a huge grin plastered on your face. However, the lack of voice acting or so much so as Nintendo-esque mumbling is very noticeable in spots. There will be occasions where awkward silences will arise and have you cursing the game’s lack of sound effects. Quests are well-written and genuinely humorous. They will have you reminiscing and wishing your imagination had been as active as the children portrayed in the game. There is one point where the player must find a costume promoting patriotism in order to gain entry into a patriot’s party. Neat little touches like this aid the game in becoming much more than the sum of its parts. All in all, Costume Quest is a game that should be experienced if only for the inner child in all of us. Its clever dialogue and adorable look will provide more than enough motivation to press through the rote gameplay mechanics that this charming, downloadable title has to offer. ",

    "review_description": "I was in a slump and didn't really want to bother with the typical game that would make me think too much, whether due to intricate puzzles or combat that required me keeping my focus on just the game.  Enter Costume Quest.  I didn't expect much from the game, though I was enlightened to see it was made by Double Fine Productions.  A company I've come to know for some quirky yet quality games.  So, I took my usual place on the couch, controller in hand, and went in search for candy and costume pieces.   Just like real life, Costume Quest starts with the simple desire to obtain tons of candy.  Of course, you're forced to go with your sibling.  The game gives you the choice to choose to play as the brother or the sister, and I chose the brother.  I've yet to see someone playing as the sister, so I wonder if it truly is even possible.  Once you get through the initial sibling rivalry, you're kicked out into the streets to go and collect candy, as is normal on Halloween.  As luck would have it, Halloween comes to life and creatures known as grubbins are out to collect candy, and your sibling just happens to be dressed as a large Candy Corn, leading to her abduction and to your night spent traversing through various environments searching for more candy, new costumes, and eventually getting your sister back from the evil grubbins. The gameplay in Costume Quest is simple.  Not mindlessly mash a single button simple, but simple enough that it doesn't require quick reflexes or tactical planning in combat or anywhere else in the game for that matter.  It's something my six year old nephew could get the hang of.  Much of your time in Costume Quest is spent acquiring candy, new costumes, questing to open up new areas and collecting stamps, which provide bonuses or new abilities in combat.  Candy is acquired by looting practically anything not nailed down, such as garbage cans and jack-o-lanterns.  Candy's is used  to buy new stamps from one of the kids who seems to follow you around to each of the three main game areas.  New costumes are how you gain new abilities, each one offering its own combat attacks and some of them offering new abilities that are required to bypass certain game areas or just helpful in avoiding the grubbins. Quests vary but all have the goal of either opening up a way to get to a new area or learning a new costume pattern.  There is a mini game in each area consisting of a bobbing for apples game which requires you get a certain number of points for a small reward.  Each area has three levels of difficulty with the mini game, though you can do it as many times as you want to try and beat your previous scores. Combat is initiated by running into a grubbin or knocking on a door that has a grubbin inside instead of the usual parent willing to fork over a ton of candy.  Once initiated, your costume takes over and you and your grubbin opponents grow in size to such a manner that you stand over the current area.  Your costume provides you with a basic attack and a super attack that charges up to full after two rounds of combat.  Combat attack types vary from three types, melee, ranged, or magical.  Each of these types have their own simple mini games that you play in with each attack, success resulting in a critical hit.  It won't take you long to get to a point where you will constantly succeed at a critical attack.  Super attacks don't have any mini game elements but are devastating attacks, area effect attacks, stuns, or heals.  For all but the final battle, you really don't need to worry about when to use a special attack or not since combat is pretty fast and it doesn't take you long to defeat most of your opponents.  As you quest to save your sister you will encounter the various kids and adults out on Halloween night, providing comments that one would expect from Double Fine and surely one of the most entertaining elements.  From the grubbins who are just trying to do the job they're commanded to do to the oblivious parents who need help fixing a train or ridding an arcade of grubbins, each area of the game is spiced up with enjoyable flavor text and really makes for a relaxing and enjoyable six to eight hours of gameplay.  As for my favorite costume combination, I loved to fight with the Vampire, Statue of Liberty, and Jack-O-Lantern costumes and had no problem completing all battles, including the end battle, with this combination.  Regardless of your costume preference, except for the last battle, it's unlikely you won't be able to succeed in all of your encounters.",

    "review_description": "  Box Art Costume Quest hits you with fun from the first moment. The game continues forward almost lackadaisically, never trying to overload the player with too many choices. This makes the game something easy to best in just a night or two. The story is easy to follow. The game mechanics are easy to perform. The game in total is easy, but without any of the negative baggage that goes along with that word.  The game’s gleefully colorful art style is reminiscent of Psychonauts, another Double Fine joint. But, during the fight sequences your giant mech, ninja, skinny pumpkin man or king (if, like me, you think this looks almost infringement worthy), and other notable Saturday morning crime fighting tropes, the game switches to a cleaner animation style. In cutscenes the game looks like an amateur cartoon, but in the fighting sequences it looks like a high production modern day computer created cartoon. The game mechanics are easy to pick up and play. It is a joy to know everything that a game can do and to be able to produce those actions at any time. All of the moves are produced by hitting the button at a set time, hitting a button immediately, or mashing a button until a meter fills. The special attacks use the same sort of input. The animations on the attacks are amusing, but become repetitive after playing for a couple of hours. Luckily, the game doesn’t last for 10 hours so the moves don’t ever get JRPG stale.  The music is bubbly and charming. The tracks sound like they could be from an old Disney produced Halloween romp. I like the decision to not use voices. It is more comical to imagine what the voices would sound like myself.    From the moment I started this game on a Friday night, until I finished it Saturday afternoon this game made me smile. Even as an adult with no children, I found this game helped me recall things about the Halloweens of my youth. It almost feels like this game is made for a child to play with his/her parents in the room or vice versa. The jocose parts of this game outlast any possible irritants.    ",

    "review_description": "While there are several Christmas games available to gamers (   Daze Before Christmas,   Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams, etc.), very few Halloween-themed games exist outside licensed games based on Halloween-themed material. Double Fine intended to rectify this when they released Costume Quest, a Halloween RPG available for the Xbox 360 and PS3. With this game, they have proved that it is possible to create a good game based on Halloween. Unfortunately, aiming to tailor the game for a younger audience, the developers have simplified a potentially good game to the point of annoyance.  Despite this, Costume Quest begins the experience very strongly. After choosing a main character, you start trick or treating with your twin sibling. Things quickly go awry, however, as monsters kidnap them, forcing the protagonist to rescue their sibling and end the monsters’ plan in the process. All of this is told through fairly humorous cutscenes that conveys an appropriately childish atmosphere. This atmosphere also includes a cartoony art style that, while technically average (characters can clip through walls and party members’ presence can cause minor graphical glitches), immensely helps what the writing tries to accomplish. Many of the characters look like very exaggerated Miis, something that makes Costume Quest appropriately feel like a kid’s show. Yet while the childish art style is an enjoyable part of the game, Costume Quest is at its graphical best during battles. Contrasting with the cartoony art style of the rest of the game, children transform into highly stylized interpretations of their costumes to defeat their enemies. Although the battles seem to aim for a B-movie/comic book motif, they oddly contribute very much to the game’s family friendly personality. In fact, it often seems like the children are imagining their encounters with the very real monsters, even if the dialogue often very directly states otherwise.    Some costumes open certain areas of the world map, although how they achieve this feat is often noticeably repeated.    Sadly, this is the only strength that the battle system possesses, because simplification has eliminated any chance of this game being enjoyable. However, much like Costume Quest in general, the idea underneath the combat is strong: when in battle, the child protagonists become whatever costume they are wearing at the time. Each costume carries with it a different special abilities into battle, such as healing or status-inducing attacks. Unfortunately, outside a few equippable stamps, these are the only ways of performing these moves, and they can only be used once every three turns. In the interim, the only available option is to attack. There are no other battle commands, like changing costumes or using items, nor do the costumes change the nature of the attacks beyond what  Paper Mario-esque timed button presses are required. Naturally, this means that battles soon become extremely repetitive and that they lack strategy. It does not help that the game recycles enemy groups both obviously and frequently, destroying any chance of strategy that Costume Quest could ever hope to have.  However, the enemies often have a wider array of moves available at any given time. While your characters are limited to two or three actions, at best, (and only one of which has no major restrictions) monsters can perform a variety of moves any time they desire, such as healing and casting status-inducing spells, both on each other and on your party members. Interestingly, while any negative effects applied to an enemy disappear one turn after they were inflicted, status effects that harm playable characters rarely go away, if at all. Logically, this should make the game very challenging, especially when coupled with the combat’s shortage of depth, and indeed, certain areas of the game are very challenging. This is most pronounced in Autumn Haven Mall, the second part of the game; enemies suddenly become much more powerful, and none of the costumes available provide much help. Because of this, you will run away from battles often, stalling progress in multiple ways. Yet outside Autumn Haven Mall, Costume Quest is a very easy game. Many enemies die very easily, and there is no penalty for failure; should you die or run away, the game simply returns you to the world map with full health and no experience/candy (the game’s currency) lost.    In terms of special abilities, the costume system is incredibly limited; only one costume can heal, and only one provides status benefits.    Predictably, the world map is no better than the battles that litter it; in fact, the two are equally repetitive. Outside battle, the primary goal is to complete quests to advance the story. Some of these include collecting more costumes to explore a wider variety of areas, playing hide and seek with fellow trick or treaters, and, of course, trick or treating. The latter quest comprises a large portion of Costume Quest and (at least initially) is less repetitive than it may seem. Not all the houses contain adults who hand out candy; some hold aggressive monsters, adding an element of suspense to an otherwise mundane part of the game. Yet because of how much trick or treating the game includes, this suspense degrades incredibly quickly, transforming it into another chore. Other quests fare no better; the types of quests available repeat as early as the second portion of the game, very often to an exact degree. Surprisingly, there are only three areas to explore in the entire game, limiting any possible excuses for such a lack of ideas. To add insult to injury, the achievements for Costume Quest list achievements only available in the downloadable content, essentially forcing dedicated players to pay for a 100% completion rate.  Simply put, Costume Quest is not worth the $15 ($20 with the downloadable content) that Double Fine charges for it. The game exhausts all of its ideas in its first moments, and it forgets to include several good ideas (costumes not available include ghosts, skeletons, the Grim Reaper, etc.). What is left is a repetitive, overly easy, and extremely bare RPG. The only advantage that Costume Quest has is the charming atmosphere, yet it is not close to enough to redeem the game of its many flaws. Although it began with a potentially great premise for a game, the end result is hard to enjoy.",

    "review_description": "Double Fine Productions (makers of Br ütal Legend, and Psychonauts) have created another masterpiece in their latest game, Costume Quest.  Costume Quest is a deceptively simple game where you play Reynold, an eight year old boy who’s been tasked with keeping his younger sister, Wren, safe on Halloween in the new city they move into. Things, however, go awry very quickly when monsters invade the town, and start stealing all the candy. The monster’s aren’t too bright as they mistake Wren’s lemon-drop costume to be a giant candy and kidnap her, and it’s up to Reynold and two new-found friends, Everett and Lucy to rescue her. Don’t let the simple premise fool you however, as this is definitely an children’s game for adults.  One presumes, based on the title, that costumes factor heavily into this turn-based RPG, and one would be very much so correct. The costumes you equip (some examples include a robot, a knight, a unicorn) determine the class that each of the three players is, and their associated powers both in and out of combat. However, unlike other costume based games of late, this one doesn’t make you want to smash your head in with your controller every time a character opens their mouths.   Side quests, such as trick-or-treating houses , collecting different types of candy, Battle Stamps (upgrades), and bobbing for apples add a nice refreshing side to   both the story and gameplay.       \" Its like South Park on Acid\" The first thing you’re going to notice about Costume Quest is the art style; it has a very animated look to it, something that we’re seeing more of these days following Borderlands. However, something about this look makes seem like the art developers for the game were watching South Park while taking massive hits on acid. Everything in the game has an almost surreal look to it. In the world maps characters have massive heads with tiny bodies, and there’s something very creepy looking about the adults in the game, but it’s difficult to put a finger on just what it is. On the flip side, in combat the characters are very crisp, and realistic looking, and along with fantastic sound, it makes the battles really pop, and come alive.                   The world is divided up into three chapters, the first in the friendly suburb of Auburn Pines, then moving to the Auburn Heights Mall, and finally a distant suburb of Fall Valley. Navigating the world is pretty simple, and there’s plenty to do. Lots of houses to trick-or-treat at (which eithers rewards you with candy, or punishes you with a monster battle), a large number of NPCs to interact from and get quests, and lots of hidden secrets and parts to costumes. Each chapter is fairly large, but well laid out so you won’t get lost, but you’ll still be left wondering how to get to that blocked off treasure chest for more candy.                   Combat is fairly standard turn based affair, but in homage to Super Mario RPG it’s also chock full of quick time events to do critical hits and defend against damage. This is both a blessing and a curse. The biggest flaw in Costume Quest is that combat gets very boring and very repetitive quickly, but you’re forced to pay attention to the fights for the quick time events. One thing about Costume Quest is that it is a very dialectic game. If you don’t catch the quick-time events it goes from being very, very easy to very, very hard very, very quickly. If you’re not watching the defense quick time events, the enemies will deal far more damage than you can recover, and if you’re missing the attack quick time events, you won’t deal enough damage to get through the battle.   The game offers you a wide variety of different types of combat options – more damage, status effects, healing, etc – but I found its easiest just to pound the enemy into pulp and not worry about poison, or stun, or any of that.  The sharp combat animations make the battles enjoyable.                   The other big issue with Costume Quest is it suffers from what I call “Fallout 3 syndrome”, which is where if you take the time to do the side quests and explore the world you’ll soon find that you’ve gotten the best equipment (costumes and stamps), have reached the max level (10), and have more cash than you’ll ever need to buy everything in the game. After this point, the last third of the game really feels like a grind. This leaves you with the dilemma: do I do the full game and grind out the last bit in a rush to get it over with? Or do I just rush the main quest and leave all the interesting stuff behind? It’s often questions like those that always come to my mind when I’m looking at my game library wondering what to play, and make me put the game back on the shelf in favour of something else, like Fallout 2. Ahem.                  Overall, I’d recommend this game to everyone who’s mature enough to look at it for the first five minutes and dismiss it as a children’s game.   The game does offer a multiplayer function, but it’s not too fulfilling: one player controls the characters in the world map, and player two picks up to control one of the characters in combat.   The story, while well written is fairly predictable, and the grinding towards the end really detracts from the experience. For its price point ($14.99 on the PSN) it falls pretty squarely amongst other games of its type (one-trick ponies like Clash of Heroes, Puzzle Quest), but the art style and refreshing uniqueness help it stand about the other contenders for your $15.                   Once you’ve beaten back Dorsilla the Witch and saved Wren, there is DLC available to take your quest further, travelling into Repugnia (the monsters home land), but I can’t imagine it being much different from the core game-play you’re already getting. So if it’s a continuation of the story you’re looking for, sure. If you’re just looking for more trick-or-treat action, just replay the game with a friend.  -Story: 3/5 – fairly basic, guy saves girl -Setting 5/5 – very unique and original -Gameplay 4/5 – While few new concepts, they actually get costume based combat to work without the grimacing and gnashing of teeth FFX-2 subjected us to. -Art   5/5 – Game looks good, if a bit trippy sometimes. Very Nightmare Before Christmas-esque -Sound: 4/5 –Sounds great, but a bit annoying here and there Overall score:   4/5 delicious, delicious pieces of candy. ",

    "review_description": "So appropriate for the time, or perhaps it isn’t fall when you read this, Costume Quest sees the adventure of brother (or sister depending on who you select) trying to save their sibling from an evil witch bent on taking all of the Halloween candy for herself. She has an army of minions go to the houses and steal the candy from the occupants. As the main character, you must fight your way through 3 levels, collecting candy along the way to the epic climax where the fate of all of the children’s candy hangs in the balance.Okay so is it any good? Well first we must examine the fact that it is a downloadable bit of gaming and not a full retail release. With that in mind, it is almost enough to look past the very short 3 levels that you get for your money. (Remember Castle Crashers?) Almost. The fact of the matter is the value of online only game snippets, is going up, so whereas I would say that 3 levels isn’t nearly worth your 15 bucks, I guess times have just changed around me. So you can’t be too surprised when you sit to play this after downloading it and find yourself finishing it that same afternoon. A shame.Perhaps with the short length, they included some replay ability? Ah, nope. Absolutely no reason whatsoever to replay this game. Well let me clarify that. There is the ability to collect every collectable item in the game during your first play through provided you are trying to do so. Not everyone is of the mindset to be watching out for such collectables but if you are, then as I mentioned, there is no need to replay this game. So if you are keeping score, we have here a short game that is only a one player affair with zero replay ability. I don’t really know what else to say about that.Surely there must be some redemptive qualities to this game. And there is. It is extremely well written. There is a level of comic writing and wit in the dialogue that I haven’t seen in a full box game much less a downloadable one in a long time. It is refreshing to see them work hard on making a funny game that has some good moments of laugh out loudness. Of course I have to play the part of evil game reviewer and mention that the dialogue takes place entirely in text bubbles above the characters’ heads. Sure you can write that off as part of the comic booky ascetic that they are going for but at the same time, the witty retorts and self awareness would have been much better if it had come from a well rounded voice actor. Preferably British. Stephen Fry perhaps. At any rate, once again you have to point to the fact that it is a 15 dollar game offered digitally, so they didn’t have much of a budget in the first play.Another point worth noting, whether this is good or bad is up to the end user, the game is very simple to master. When I say simple, I mean the learning curve is basically a straight line. There is a very tiny RPG implementation to the characters but it is very small. There is experience and you level up. You have two stats: Health points and Attack power. When you get into a battle, you have two or three options depending on your item you equipped. (some offer an additional option for your turn such as stunning an opponent). So you have your basic attack which is always available, and then you have a special attack that takes 3 turns to charge up. And that’s it. Very simple. Anyone could get the hang of this assuming they wanted to. So once again, whether that’s good or bad I will let you decide. For what it’s worth, I happened to enjoy the simplistic gameplay, then again I didn’t pay for my copy.Now I don’t want to sound all doom and gloom about this game. It is not without it’s charm. There is a reason to buy it right there. What it comes down to is what the game is worth to you. I don’t think it’s worth 15 bucks. I would buy it for 5. The costumes have little abilities. The items you buy and equip to your characters are a nice little touch. And probably the best part are the battle sequences. They get tedious, at least I thought so, but they are still nifty. You get this little transformation where your character goes from a cardboard box robot to a full transformer style robot. The battles themselves take place over the entire level because everything is blown up to over the top scale. In fact you could say the entire battle sequence in general is over the top including the great ending battle. So just keep that in mind before you judge for yourself okay?Released October 20th, 2010",

The battle system is great, consisting of simple QTE events and the awesome animations that go along with the different costumes special abilities, I couldn't help but actively seek out fights when I could. While it lacks in variety in terms of enemies, fights and areas, it makes up for with many other positive aspects. Seeing my candy bag fill up, learning what powers each costume had, feeling that bit of nostalgia of getting dressed up and running around with friends on Halloween maybe this game something I will seek to go back to every year around the same time.",

    "review_description": "While Costume Quest will definitely reawaken fond childhood memories of Halloween and the thrill or trick-or-treating, it isn't a game you'll remember you played a couple of years from now (the trophies may serve as a reminder). The RPG-lite gameplay is intentionally kept at an extremely simplistic level. While this may help attract and appeal to a younger audience, I can speak from a child's perspective (given that my 4 year old son played this with me) in saying that it didn't really seem to work. For anyone else playing the game, the battles will just grind on you and the flow of combat has absolutely no variety. There were also some framerate issues in the battles, which struck me as odd given the low tech nature of the rest of the game. While the game had some charm and I saw it through the end, I had no motivation to pick up the DLC and don't think I would have finished it if there were another 2 hours of gameplay.",

    "review_description": "Costume Quest, by Doublefine Productions, creators of the cult classic Psychonauts, led by fan-favorite developer Tim Schafer is an adorably earnest celebration of childhood imagination, centered around that holy grail of childhood, Halloween. Following a male-or-female main character (depending on who you choose) as they attempt to rescue their twin sibling from horrible monsters who are going around ransacking the town and stealing all the candy (and that's terrible) the game become an incredibly solid turn-based RPG. With a clever take on random encounters (will it be a grown-up, or a monster behind that door?) the game's combat transforms the character's costumes from cardboard and duct tape to pure awesome, as representations of what those children's costumes were designed around battle the monsters, using Paper Mario-style QTE integrated turn based combat.Unfortunately, while the game is undeniably charming, there isn't all that much there. I personally played the recent PC port, which included the DLC expansion Grubbins On Ice, but even with that the game only clocks in at around 8 hours-- And that was for a 100% completion run. Still, I can't say I would have preferred the game to be any longer either. The combat has very little depth to it, introducing \"Battle stamps\" which equip your character with special effects in combat. Unfortunately, since each character can only have one stamp equip at a time, there's not much strategy to the game. Also, Costume Quest doesn't have nearly as many laugh out loud moments as, say, Psychonauts, though they are certainly still there.Still, while these complaints hold Costume Quest back from being something great, they don't keep the game from being quite good. The game's charm and very cool costumes kept me entertained, and made me want to see the rest of the game. It's also nice to see a turn based RPG out there that doesn't focus on length by adding hours of level grinding, instead giving a small, focused experience. The game is easily recommendable, and the price point of $15 isn't unreasonable, especially when some modern games only give you 4-5 hours of single player gameplay for $60. Costume Quest is a game you won't regret playing, but if you're like me, you might wish there were just a bit more there, both mechanically, and in terms of length.",

    "review_description": "Costume Quest is a feeble attempt for a Haloween themed casual game from Double Fine and it's just way too underdeveloped and simple in its every aspect to be anything worth remembering.   Story is simple. It's Halloween night and two siblings, Reynold and Wren, are asked by their mother to go out with their costumes and make new friends  by trick or treating, but one of the siblings( dpends on your choice ) is taken away by a monster and the other one must venture into an Halloween nightadventure to save her/him.   CQ's game-play is consisted of exploration and turn based JRPG style combat. Both aspects are extremely simple without any sort of real challenge. Exploration is mostly about finding NPCs that give you quests, finding six hidden kids in each level, fining candies scattered around ( they act as currency ) and finally finding houses that you have to trick or treat. ( It's a part of the main quest. ) There are 4 levels ( counting Grubbins on Ice DLC which is included in PC version ) and all of the actions mentioned above should be done in them without any kind of variety which makes the game super boring and unexciting. Other half of the game ( turn based combat ) is better and more interesting, but still, it has the same problem. It's simplistic and shallow.  Everytime you encounter an enemy, you are directed to the battle screen and the costumes your characters wear turn into a stylish semi realistic version of themselves. Your normal attacks can do more damage if you press certain buttons in a certain time ( depends on the kind of attack ) which makes the combat a bit more engaging. Each costume has its own spectacular talent ( which gets unlocked after 3 turns ), some are aggressive, some defensive and some supportive. Except costumes, battle stamps have a slight effect on the way combat goes too. But the problem is that some of them are very overpowered and make losing by getting your characters killed impossible, even if you want to.  Even if you lose ( which rarely happens ), there are no consequences and you can do the battle again without losing anything. But still, combat in the game can be a mild amusement( especially at first ) and all those flashy animations for special abilities sometimes feel very rewarding. Double Fine games are known for their humorous approach to their subject matter. Unfortunately, humor in CQ is very very childish and chessy and most of the dialogues in the game ( which are not voice acted ) sound like they're take from a kid TV show whcih even kids find too childish. There are some one liners here and there, but they can't save the humor in the game to be an absolute bore. Considering the humor and the simpleness of everything else in the game, CQ is obviously a game direted at a young audience. Visual style in the game also leaves a lot to be desired. Since this game is Haloween themed, it would have been better to use a more serious, darker,creepier visual style for it. ( by keeping the lighthearted feeling of the game of course. Kinda like some Tim Burton movies. ) But the current style gets old too fast and it's more appropriate for games with jungles and green areas which CQ doesn't have.   There are games that don't take themselves seriously, there's no problem in that. But CQ has gone too far with it and the result is a lazy boring game which you have to force yourself to finish, although it's already short.",

    "review_description": "Download Size: 1.5 GBTime to Finish: 1 hour, 40 minutesMost Impressive Level: The CavesPrice I'd Pay: $5Steam Price (2/15/12): $10Like a good horror game, Dear Esther insists upon being played at a certain time: a half-hour before sunset, with the lights dim, when you won't be interrupted for 2 hours. It is for thoughtful times, those periods where you don't feel like doing anything but pondering the path you've taken so far. It's not so much a game as it is remnants of a story you silently wander through, tracing the routes and memories of a man.The man narrates to you throughout the game, starting the moment you wash ashore onto an apparently-abandoned island. It takes a moment to learn the controls: you can only walk & look. There is no interaction, just movement and observation, listening to the man as he explains what he did here, or what this reminds him of, or something not related at all. You are soaking in a story, and although there's a few pieces of it you can seek out or just ignore, for the majority of the game you simply follow the path towards your destination. The journey is the point here; I won't go into the what, lest it ruin your enjoyment of it, but instead the how.A Pool of Bitter DreamsThe narration is good if perhaps a tad too subdued, and the music is properly atmospheric ala Portal or Half-Life 2, but the graphics during the last 2 levels deserve major kudos for beauty & atmosphere. It manages a few jaw-dropping moments out of something as simple as a cave with a pool, or a moon overlooking a harbor. It's a pity the first 2 levels look similar & mundane in comparison; I think they could've been condensed into one level without losing any story or appreciation for Abandoned Island in Daylight.So, were the graphics and story worth it? It depends. This is an unusual \"game\", a situational one whose enjoyment relies on your current mood more than any fun mechanics stored within. If you're still interested in it, I would suggest you check it out. But not immediately. Instead, wait until it goes on sale and store it someplace safe, until the time comes when you're in the proper mood for it. Like a fine, rare wine, it is consumed quickly; save it for an occasion you can savor it.",

    "review_description": "I dislike having to assign a final score to a \"game\" such as this one. Review scores are of course the classic compromise between an insightful description and a lack of time and/or patience on behalf of the reader. It's easy to argue that, despite the problems associated with distilling an entire experience into something as simple as a number, it generally a usable metric for how fun and entertaining an experience the product provided.Personally, I would not associate the word \"fun\" nor the word \"entertaining\" with Dear Esther. But neither would I associate the respective opposites with it either. It is an experience. One I have yet to determine if I find worthy of the price of admission. I think arguing from a stand point of uniqueness, the answer would have to be yes. Dear Esther is quite unlike 99% of the other games on the market. Arguably because it is not a game, but it sort of plays like one.Slight spoilers ahead.You're put in the shoes of a protagonist who makes his way across a beautiful yet at the same time barren landscape. A tale is woven through voiceover, presumably by the protagonist hinting at events surrounding himself and other characters. The narrative of the game is at times relatively vague, but in my opinion there are several strong hints at what the whole game is actually about, and that is, in my opinion, at the core of this game. Here, the journey is literally the crux of the game, and not the end. Although I will admit that I still enjoyed the ending.In some ways I feel an effort like this should be applauded because it breaks with a number of standardized practicies by putting the unique experience at the forefront. You're not told exactly how and what you can interact with or what the actual point is. Eventually it becomes clear that there's very little to interact with directly, but you are - in fact - never told that this is so. Refreshing and freeing in a way. But also uncomfortable because games provide a gateway into a world whose reality you have not had a life time to become accustomed to. Occasionally, you might feel a niggling thought occur that there is more beneath the surface just waiting to be discovered, if you only knew how. Some would probably argue that this is what makes it all the more special. Perhaps...So why have I given this game 4 out of 5 stars? Because I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But I feel it almost impossible to tell anyone else how or why they would. The uniqueness is its strongest selling point in my opinion, and while I would appreciate more experiences like this on the market, I'm not sure how I would feel about them dominating it. The final missing star hints at the concessions made in regards to the engine. Funneling the player is quite common in games, but I would have compromised more on the artistic expression, in order to avoid problems like ankle high fences/hills that are impossible to pass. An interview with the creator also noted that the engine itself required a compromise during the ending. This, and the aforementioned issue, along with a few tiny details not worth mentioning, is why I stay at 4 out of 5. Having an engine built specifically for Dear Esther would not have been feasible, but it would have made the experience better for it...",

    "review_description": "SPOILERS AHEADI am fairly open minded, but the game Dear Esther has seemed to completely destroy any sense of open mindedness I have. Of course, I am not the biggest fan of indie movies, which are dripping with pretentious themes and brooding characters. That might be the main reason why I did not like Dear Esther.Of course, since the entire tagline to the game seems to be about how it is not necessarily a game, I will not judge it as such. In truth, it seems to be more like an interactive experience. You do not interact with the world. In fact, you never even touch it. The only thing that you do is that the character turns on his flashlight when he goes into dark spaces, but that's the only world interaction that you get.My main problem with Dear Esther is that when taken as a storytelling experience, it's quite weak. The ending is complete bullshit and the entire setup to the end does not really satisfy any loose ties about the characters that inhabit the world. Is the world just a dream? I would have to guess so. The way that objects in the world are still there make the visuals very cool and interesting, but they make no damn sense. If he's the only one on the island, then why are all these candles lit? There’s an ethereal way that the character moves, and when he jumps to his death at the end, I could only laugh at the slowest death in existence. Also, the screen fades to black. Death or Bug?Ultimately, I don't like this game because it does not seem to realize that showing not telling is the most important part of a game. When the character gets an infection on his leg, I would rather it shown on the person, rather than it being told in a rather droll way. I would also prefer that the slow act of the character dying as he's making his way to the place where he'll jump actually being shown. Maybe have the character black out, or his vision getting blurry?The reality is that the game could have taken place anywhere. There is really no reason that the guy was in that island at all other than to create a strong sense of visual narrative which the game completely does not capitalize on. The writings on the cave walls I thought were actually going to have some more significant meaning, but they did not either. Ultimately, there was no point to the game being on that island in the first place and I feel like that ruins the entire experience. I actually started getting angry when I realized just how inconsequential the setting was.Sure, the game is beautiful, but the world doesn't really do much for me story wise. There wasn't enough environmental storytelling to really tell you what the game was really all about, and I felt cheated at the end. So cheated in fact that I felt like I had to review it. I'm sure that people will tell me that I dont' get it but that's the entire point. There really isn't anything to get. There are a few points where you feel emotional, but it's certainly not for the world around me and it's not because of the drivel that the main character is telling me. It's because the music feels emotional.It's not that I don't like experimental videogames. I rather enjoy them. But there's a difference between what some people consider good art and what some people consider bad art. I feel like this is bad art to me. Art is subjective, though.In conclusion I am probably being overly harsh in my review. But I don't care. I regret the hour it took me to play this game and I wish that I had not sunk that time into it.In conclusion I am probably being overly harsh in my review. But I don't care.

    "review_description": "Dear Esther is hard to review. Not a game, but built in a game engine. Worth discussing but better left unspoiled. But here goes.You awake on an island with no instruction other than the narration of a letter addressed to an unknown ‘Esther’. The sea to one side, a small, run down cottage behind you and a blinking beacon in the distance, calling you towards it with no other signs of life. Given no direction of where to go other than the paths in the landscape, it’s up to you to discover where to go, how to get there, and more importantly, why you should be going there. Everything is left a mystery until discovered, and even then most of the experience is left open to interpretation.You cannot run, pick up items, solve puzzles or fire a gun. You have a flashlight, but it’s decided for you when it turns on. By removing the traditional first person mechanics, extra detail must be paid to everything surrounding you. I often stopped moving once the narrator began to speak, pausing for a moment to unravel what he is saying and why it is being said. These clips of narration are often tied to the environment around you; a story of how something has come to be. What the narrator describes brings into question the surroundings, a brief sentence mentioning a drive down the M5 when no roads are to be seen.Using the Portal 2 engine, Dear Esther embraces it’s slow, methodical pacing to give you every oppurtunity to take in the stunning surroundings. It’s rare to see this much attention to detail in a virtual landscape, and it holds up to the close scrutiny that Esther emplores you to use. Lighting is used carefully to set the melancholy tone of the piece, and used to effect when attention needs to be drawn. The attention to detail in sound design is similar. Look out to the sea and you’re met with a gust of the ocean breeze, birds timed to fly by and squawk after a moment of complete silence.I really can’t say much more without getting into the story, which shouldn’t be spoiled at all. At about an hour for a complete playthrough it’s short, but packed with detail and care. Consequent playthroughs include new sets of narration but I think, for me, I only want to play it once. It’s an experience well worth the asking price on Steam, a short but un-forgettable journey through a fully realised story. The ending left me a little disappointed, not because of what happened but because of my lack of control over it. Turn off the lights, plug in the headphones and give yourself a couple of hours to play it, take it in and think about it. Dear Esther will lead to many “games as art” debates but it really shouldn’t. Dear Esther isn’t a game. It’s just art.http://lostglovesociety.wordpress.com",

While I was intrigued by the claims I was reading about the game's presentation and narrative, my excitement was tempered about the claims that the game did not have much, if any, gameplay. Ultimately I was convinced when I showed my wife a trailer of the game and observed her excitement as a non-gamer. At her behest Dear Esther was purchased, and after playing a chapter she has not touched it since. I, on the other hand, have taken the 2 hour dive and will try to explain what you can and cannot expect from Dear Esther.You are guaranteed a beautiful landscape that is meticulously crafted for visual delight. It is clear that the designer polished every possible detail to ensure that the scenery is stunning from every one of the viewing angles that the game allows. All of this is done using the Source engine, which makes me fairly sure that the experience will scale nicely to older machines. The only downside in terms of the visuals, is the fact that the camera feels slightly detached (this may be on purpose) and the viewing angle tends to create a fish-eye effect. If you are careful with the zoom button, you shouldn't feel the need to vomit off one of Dear Esther's many cliffs.You also get the ability to navigate and admire this landscape. What you do not get, is anything more in the way of interaction. If Dear Esther was a point-and-click adventure, there would only be \"move to\" and \"look at\" commands. At the very least, it would have been interesting to pick up and examine some objects, but whether by design or financial constraints you are constrained to observation and the aforementioned nausea inducing zoom.And ultimately there is a story, delivered through earnest narration and a subtle yet affecting score. Dear Esther's story however, is more poetry than prose. The narration plays in randomized clips that are ambigious with the supposed intention that you will interpret them for yourself. Do not expect Dear Esther to explain itself to you.With this being said, it is clear that the design principles of Dear Esther are geared toward making it better art. Whether it succeeds at being art I'm neither qualified nor inclined to answer. The same design decisions do not make for much of a play experience, and it will be up to you to decide whether you are OK with that. Personally I found Dear Esther to be like a colourful street festival, I got swept up in the buzz and looked at the colourful displays, but ultimately, I didn't buy anything.",

    "review_description": "ImageDear Esther,I have found myself to be as featureless as this ocean… For once, I agree with the voice; when I peer into the water, I see no reflection. Lately, the voice has been talking more and more about a serious leg injury, unbearable pain, a life-threatening infection and a quantity of pain-killers that would make even Rush Limbaugh blush. But the walker plods on without complaint, my steady pace maintained in the face of the character’s laments. The walker’s footsteps are often silent, and when audible have the regularity of clockwork. I look down into a chasm, and as the voice fills me in on its significance, I edge a little too close to get a better look— and fall in.-The NarratorLast night, Boyfriend and I played Dear Esther. I use the word play very loosely. There is debate among the gaming community as to whether this \"experience\" qualifies as a \"game\" since there is actually very little interaction involved. The game is a first-person exploration of an island, underscored with a gorgeous soundtrack by Jessica Curry, and interspersed with monologues spoken by the unseen narrator. There is no real sense of who you are in the game and there is no real story. The \"plot\" is designed to be a free-form experience and once the game ends (yes there is a point where you know your game has ended) it is up to the player to interpret the events of the game.Boyfriend and I knew nothing about the game other than the trailer we'd seen, so I can't say we were completely thrilled with the game right away. It's a digest-what-happened-and-then-form-an-opinion-about-it kind of thing. Nevertheless, Boyfriend and I enjoyed it overall. The graphics are breathtaking and the experience as a whole, I think, is one every gamer should have. We went through the game in about 2 hours, but, according to the website, each time you play through the game the \"narrative\" of the spoken letters to Esther changes slightly, so you can have a different experience each time, and possibly come to different conclusions about who Esther is, what the island is, and the relationship between them.Can I recommend this game? Maybe. If you're the type of gamer who loves the storyline and the characters and the interaction of gameplay, then, you probably won't care for Dear Esther. It's like a visual piece of literature that you're reading out of order. I applaud The Chinese Room and the entire Dear Esther team for releasing a beautiful if not, experimental piece of art that is this game.I gave Dear Esther 3.5 out of 5. The art and soundtrack were beautiful and haunting, but I don't know that I would consider it a \"game\" per se. It is an experience that I would recommend simply for its bravery to take a giant leap in an unexpected direction as far as the nature of video games goes.",

    "review_description": "Dear Esther is a very odd piece of work. As a game it is monotonous and vague, as a story it's very difficult to comprehend, as an experience...Well it's a mixed bag, it has some fantastic moments however it deffinitly isn't without its vices. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of my initial 2.5 or 3 rating is because I thought to myself 'you know what, this is going to be in my mind effecting me for quite a while' which has lots to say for itself compared to many games, or even many pieces of entertainment.I had this game recommended to me from the Giant Bomb forums for similar plays to the outstanding 'To The Moon', reading the summary of it sounded like it would be very up my ally as it was discribed as \"intresting\", \"more story than gameplay\" and \"a profound experience\" to name a few. So I bought the game with a hot headed determanation to get something not dissimilar from my experience of To The Moon. And buoy I needed it...My first impressions of the game where that the interesting foggy remote island that could be out of England somewhere was at least an original choice followed by the enjoyable tones of the narrator of which reminded me of Sherlock. These thoughts were soon followed by trying to piece the set up together. The rest of the game consisted of the same thoughts.Looking at it from a very gamey perspective, it's nothing more than Epic Citadel but using the much less graphicly impressive source engine and instead of the Infinity Blade castle its an extract of some lands from Oblivion. Or aka a really shit version of Oblivion with no NPC's, stupidly crippling movement pace and occassionally triggering Sherlock Holmes narrating every so often. Well the last bit would probs make Oblivion more classy but that's a story for another day.The narrative felt over complex after I had triggered narrative parts as I progressed, this made me feel stupid which made me initially dislike the game for making me think I am. However I soon realised the fault was not mine, these paragraphs would take a veteran reader of literature a run for his or her money. To ask a gamer who is trying to also navigate around a world and figure out where to go whilst also piecing these seemingly irrelevant phrases into context is pretty redonkulous.So why did I continue playing Dear Esther and continue on to write a positive review for it? I asked myself the same question about 40 minutes in telling myself I should probably do something more productive than crippling my index finger held over the forward arrow for so long whilst embracing Oblivions scenery. However at this point I found myself strangely compelled to carry on. I assumed I was in some sort of trance where I was not really paying much attention to navigating my charcter and not paying too much attention to the narrative, letting my subconscious juggle these things about whilst not really thinking of alot. It was a strange experience rivalled possibly by a large amount of narcotics or hypnotism. After about 30 minutes in this trance I started to feel abit freaky so I had a break and read into the game to quell actually what the fuck I was playingAfter reading into some of the gooey of the game on IGN and Wikipedia, I noticed that the game was probably trying to achieve this state of mind within me, as the context of the narration was never intended to be comprehended so easily and the crippling pace was purposely done. Once returning to the game I felt a little like the magicians trick had been revelled here but still enjoyed it.Ultimately this game isn't the be all or end all, super-ultimate-thinking-indie-is-the-way-forward, life changer. Nor did I find it make me reflect on my own life much or cause a rapid amount of profound thoughts about what is life. However I did find it to be an experience I definitely hadn't felt much of before and the vast amount of symbolism in the game will hunt my dreams for decent while now.",

    "review_description": "This slow, barely interactive, goal-less virtual novel is an atmospheric masterpiece. We've seen some games that focus on atmosphere more than plot or gameplay such as LIMBO, Journey, Flower, and Heavy Rain but none of those hit the highs that Dear Esther not only hits, but maintains for its entire duration. Despite doing nothing other than walking around, Dear Esther is immersive with beautifully rendered scenery, poetic and ambigious narration and a chilling score. There are no achievements for climbing that path to follow a dim light, but you'll find yourself doing it anyway and never regretting it.It's criminally short length (about an hour) doesn't quite justify it's price, but the short length is appropriate for the story so the game doesn't feel like it's overstaying its welcome. Kudos to a developer who doesn't run a game overlong just because gamers expect long games. If you do decide to take the plunge, it can be very rewarding and is utterly unique.",

    "review_description": "There is a lot to say about Dear Esther, which is quite a feat considering the game only lasts for about one hour and thirty minutes. Originally published as a mod for the source engine in 2008 by developer thechineseroom, it has been rebuilt with better visuals and level design and made available for purchase on Steam. Created to be more of an experience rather than a game, Dear Esther is a unique take on the first person genre.The story starts off with a man, presumably the character you are playing as, reading a letter to an unknown character named Esther while standing on the shore of what seems to be a fairly large island. From here, the player walks along the islands various paths, finding interesting areas to explore along the way. While walking along the paths and when reaching key points on the island, the main character will continue to read different passages of his letters, all of which seemed to be addressed to this unseen 'Esther'. The visual exploration and the reading of the letters are all there is to the experience, so thankfully Dear Esther handles both of these things extraordinarily well.The graphics, built using Valve's source engine, are absolutely stunning. Although it is not the most technically advanced game out there, Dear Esther uses the source engine to its utmost potential. The wind near the shore blows with great force, leaves fly through the air, and the grass waves around almost realistically. The entire island is constructed in a very smart way, with multiple paths and landmarks to witness along your journey. From an old cottage sea house, to vast caves, to crashed ships, there is a lot to see and a lot to take in. As you traverse the island throughout the games four chapters, what you see and experience is quite extraordinary. The lighting of the setting sun and moon, the quietness of the island, and the bleak, cold air all bring out a strong set of emotions within the player. As I started my journey I had feelings of excitement and adventure and by the end I had experienced feelings of awe, wonder, and sadness. The island surrounds you in so much mystery that you can't help but get so many mixed emotions. This only fuels the desire to continue to move forward and discover what more the island has to offer.While half of the story is told through the visuals, the other half comes from the narration. Each letter read is generally related to an object or a landmark that you are currently viewing so the writing and the visuals work together to lead you along what has happened on this island. While there are many clear connections between what you are seeing and hearing, the writing is not by any means meant to tell you exactly what is going on. Every letter is filled with ambiguity. Also, this is not your standard video game narration. The writing uses very dense language that is filled with symbols and metaphors, so much so that at times I felt like I was being read a Walt Whitman poem. I have very mixed feelings about this mainly because the writing is so creative and thought provoking that I found myself losing track of what was being said. With such beautiful scenery to look at at the same time, I found that I needed to stop walking around and focus on only the writing to be able to understand even a little of what was going on. If I focused on the environment while a letter was being read, I wouldn't hear any of the reading, and if I focused on the words while continuing to walk I would completely miss out on parts of the environment. I would have liked to have been able to focus on both parts of the game at once, but the dense writing made that pretty much impossible to do.Another issue I have with the game is the total lack of interaction with the world. Beyond being able to walk around, you can not do anything else with the environment. While being able to jump was obviously unnecessary, it would have really added to the experience if I could have picked up items in the world and inspected them, or if there was a set of collectibles to find that added more material and insight into the game's story. While the game still handles what it does remarkably well, that extra amount of interactivity would have went a long way toward fully immersing me within the world.With all nit picking aside, Dear Esther is a truly wonderful experience because it tells its story in such a unique way. Instead of hand feeding the player the exact information to piece together the mystery of what is going on, Dear Esther gives the player just enough pieces to put together the story in the way they see fit. Rather than having one clear cut narration, the story of Dear Esther can be interpreted in many different ways. This gets the player to think creatively and gives you a different kind of feeling than pretty much any other game you can play. When I finished the game, I made sense of it all in my own personal way, which was something I don't think I have ever done with a game before. While it could have done a bit more to better the experience, Dear Esther is one of the most thought provoking and creative works of art in the game industry.",

    "review_description": "Dear Esther. I sometimes feel as if I’ve given birth to this island. Somewhere, between the longitude and latitude a split opened up and it beached remotely here. No matter how hard I correlate, it remains a singularity, an alpha point in my life that refuses all hypothesis. I return each time leaving fresh markers that I hope, in the full glare of my hopelessness, will have blossomed into fresh insight in the interim.Dear Esther is one of these titles that defy our common conceptions about what video games should be. It can be considered an anti-game, or perhaps a game that transcends the genre. Personally I perceive it as an amazing experiment in interactive storytelling.Released on February 14th 2011, Dear Esther is a re-make of a free Half-Life mod from a few years back. Although it utilizes Valve’s Source engine and a first-person perspective, it has very little else in common with other games running on this technology. There are no guns, no cover system, no sprint button. You find yourself on the shore of a cold English island and are left to roam around exploring the deserted environment in search of a better understanding of who you are, why are you there and what has happened to you in the past.The story is delivered in scattered pieces of narration triggered as you explore the environment bit by bit. It never really paints a full picture nor provides any definite answers to the questions you may have. Instead, it masterfully sets the mood and deals with emotions rather than with absolutes.Visually, Dear Esther is a stunning piece. Just like the AAA titles created by Valve, it manages to utilize the Source engine to its full potential, proving once again something I have been always claiming about this particular piece of tech. The Source engine is not nearly as powerful as some of the contemporary heavyweights such as CryEngine or Unreal. It lacks many of the bells and whistles the others have, pushes fewer polygons per frame and often has to resolve into sprite trickery.It is, however, an engine that does wonders when put in hands of a skilled art director. Based on the concept art by Ben Andrews and designed by Robert Briscoe, the game is a true work of art. It utilizes color palettes that always border on the verge of photo-realism, while maintaining artistic composition and flow. It truly pulls the player in and fleshes out a tactile, believable world filled with immaculate attention to detail.From the cold afternoon sights of the opening chapter, through stunning cave system filled with bioluminescent flora to the full-mooned night in the conclusion, every step of your journey is a true feast for the eyes. During my first two-hour playthrough I have accumulated a total of nearly 200 screenshots in an attempt to capture and own a piece of this experience.It is impossible to talk about the story of the game without spoiling the experience to those who haven’t yet played through this title. It will unfold to you at perfectly timed moments as you explore the island, providing the narrative context to the environments you visit. A by-line provided by the studio on the official site, however, manages to set the tone and provide you with an idea of what Dear Esther is about: “A deserted island… a lost man… memories of a fatal crash… a book written by a dying explorer.”If I was to draw comparisons to other titles, the two that come to mind are “The Graveyard” by Tale of Tales and “Trauma” by Krystian Majewski. By the sheer amount of work put into it by the developers, Dear Ester reaches far beyond the other two games in terms of the experience it provides as well as audio-visual fidelity.As many innovative works of art in the past, Dear Esther immediately polarized the audience – so you may think twice before purchasing it. For me it was a no-brainer and would wholeheartedly recommend this title to anyone looking for something different in video games. The $10 price should not be considered as the “game’s price tag”, but rather as an “admission ticket” to the interactive installation/experience.Developed by the Chinese Room, Dear Esther is available for purchase for PC on Steam. According to the offical website, the official game soundtrack by Jessica Curry will be available soon.Official websitehttp://dear-esther.com/Steam pagehttp://store.steampowered.com/app/203810/This review has been originally published on QubaHQ.",

    "review_description": "Dear Esther, developed by thechineseroom, is not considered by all to be a game. It is. Dear Esther is a game that grabbed me, a game that surprised me. Even with the shortcomings of the game play, it is a significant piece of work that will stun you with the presentation, and stir you with its story.I have never been one to really care about stories in games, films and novels just seem to grab me in a more profound way. However, there are exceptions to said rule, and Dear Esther has earned its place on that list. The tale spun in Dear Esther is almost completely what you make of it. There are no twists, there is no mind bending moment, there is only the simple story told through a journey across an island, and through spoken word. The narrative in Dear Esther could be considered minimalistic in that sense and I believe that is why it achieves what it sets out to do. As the narrator recounts the history of the island, and informs the player of his current situation, subtle visual cues on the island aide him in his storytelling. The writing is beautiful, and paced very well, as for the story itself, all I will say is that I was very invested in it, and proper closure was provided. Dear Esther provides a perfectly melancholy tale that will provide ideal company for a doleful soul.As skillfully as the story in Dear Esther is told, I fear it would not have gotten as much out of me if not for the lovely visuals. In no way does Dear Esther seek to wow you with its presentation, that’s a good thing though. The mixture of muted colors and astounding vistas immerse you in the world, as well as the commentary immerses you in narrative. You trek across a frigid, blustery island, over hills covered in wet moss, and through caves adorned with beaming algae and looming stalactite. There are no animals, nor humans on this island, only the flora to escort you on your journey. Aforementioned visual cues will subtly guide you on the path the game wishes for you take. The sense of immersion is exceedingly impactful in Dear Esther; it’s a huge part of what make the game so successful in its goal. It’s also worth noting that the woeful, imposing soundtrack only works to benefit the atmosphere on the barren, grassy isle. Unfortunately, with the fantastic storytelling and visual work, comes the expectation of game play that will live up to those standards. Unfortunately it is in the realm of game play that Dear Esther falters.With a look that inspires such captivation, Dear Esther leaves the player without a way to effect the environment. There is not really any need to impact the environment though, and that proves to be another problem. Dear Esther requires you to do nothing but walk, and while I wish that was not the case, it is possible that the lack of investment in mechanics leaves me more able to commit attention to the story. Nevertheless, there is not much meat beneath the surface of this work. The narration moves at its own pace, a flashlight is drawn automatically in dimly lit areas, and you are only able to walk at an unhurried stride. You may zoom, there is a fail state with an instant respawn, and you may take alternate routes through the island, but many lead to a dead end. That’s about it for the mechanics.A shame, even with the sweeping sounds that fill you with sorrow, a downhearted tale that will consume you, and a graphical quality that demand your attention, Dear Esther is not able to reach its potential with the drawbacks of its game play. Although it may not be perfect, Dear Esther is important, and something worth experiencing for yourself.",

    "review_description": "Dear Esther is very pretty.So…that’s all? Not quite. While the visual artistry of the island that you visit as the unnamed protagonist is stunning, the goal of this game is to serve as an example that games can be more than just violence simulators. I feel that it would be more appropriate to call Dear Esther a work of interactive fiction. You traverse a mysterious island, and all you need to do is listen to the audio log like pieces of prose that the protagonist is speaking out loud.There are invisible triggers in the environment that cause the next piece of story to be revealed to the player. This means that basically the movement of the player dictates the pacing of the story. So is it any good?Well, I have mixed feelings. I adore the work done by the visual designers and audio designers. They work perfectly in tandem to create a haunting and captivating atmosphere of an abandoned island. But they are only there to serve the writing of the fiction. I personally am not that into poetry. The thing is that the story is presented by a protagonist who has personal issues. The bits and pieces of story aren’t easily understood. Who is Esther, Donelly and Jacobson? It isn’t clear, because no further exposition is provided by the game outside of the poetic ramblings of the protagonist. I have checked out some discussions on forums about the meaning of the game, and opinions vary widely. Some think that the island itself is a metaphor, and its features (many many stones, shipwrecks and chemical diagrams painted on cave walls) as well. Some say that the protagonist is already dead and just traversing a sort of limbo on the island.Whatever the meaning of the story, Dear Esther is only as enjoyable as you can find interest in the writing. Outside of that, it’s really just a pretty graphics demo. There is hardly any interactivity aside from movement, and therefore no meaningful choices can be made.Personally, I don’t believe the strength of video games to be in the space that Dear Esther explores, but as an experiment in linear story telling it is definitely worthy of experiencing it once, if only for the amazing atmosphere it provides.",

    "review_description": "Dear Esther is the antithesis of the traditional video game, to the point where it’s debatable whether it’s a game at all. The only player actions are moving through the world and looking around, while the only thing close to a gameplay goal is to progress through the environments until you reach the end. Dear Esther doesn’t aim to engage you through action, strategy, or puzzles, but through mystical surroundings, poetic narration, and haunting music.In many ways the world of Dear Esther itself feels deliberately lifeless.The “game” takes place on an unpopulated island in the Outer Hebrides, where as you hike across the wind-blasted cliff tops and through the damp underground caverns, you listen to a series of letters addressed to a woman named Esther being read aloud. These letters don’t simply impart a story, but consist of carefully constructed metaphors and evocative imagery. The tale they tell is somewhat ambiguous and open to interpretation, but they clearly point to an event of a certain nature in the author’s life. Themes of discovery and melancholy run throughout, as do recurring reflections on the subject of death. Occasionally the metaphors feel forced and the game feels like it makes some slightly uncomfortable stretches to achieve a lack of clarity in its story, but taken as a whole it's a rather powerful piece of writing, especially because of the way it ties into the aesthetics of the experience.The environments of Dear Esther are more modest and reserved than those of the average video game, but do sometimes verge on the fantastical. There are locations such as large open caves daubed with fluorescent paint, presenting a beautiful and mysterious element to the island, but the majority of the areas, which are grassy desolate coastlines and quiet beaches strewn with the rusted wreckage of boats and cars, build with the story towards a memorable sense of loss and loneliness. This is only amplified by the echoing choral music and sorrowful piano and orchestral pieces of the game’s soundtrack. The sombre tone of Dear Esther is one that sticks with you long after you’ve walked away from your PC.A lot of talent and effort has clearly gone into creating this game.As affecting as Dear Esther can be, there did come a point where I began to wonder whether a video game was the best format for the experience it’s trying to create. By putting you in the driver’s seat, Dear Esther allows you to explore as much or as little of the environments as you want, but there’s only so much in the way of diversions, the game is a largely linear affair, and pacing remains roughly the same on each playthrough, with there being a very fixed speed at which you can move. I’m all for games that are trying to push the limits of the medium, and the interactive element certainly helps colour the experience, but when you realise that almost all your left hand has been doing for the last 45 minutes is holding down the “W” key, you start to wonder how integral your input really is to what’s going on. Given that you can complete it in under an hour without rushing, I don’t think Dear Esther fully justifies its £7 price tag either.In pricing and providing engaging interactivity, Dear Esther has its issues, but for those who’ve wanted to see a game that escapes the standard fun and empowerment of most interactive entertainment, and replaces it with lingering sadness and poetic presentation, Dear Esther is a journey you can’t afford to miss.",

    "review_description": " Dear Esther is a walk through a story game created by The Chinese Room. In this game you are going to be walking around and through an island that is apparently deserted and as you go a story will unfold in front of you.Graphically this game looks amazing, the atmosphere of the island draws you in and all you want to do is take more steps along the beach, up the path, through the caves, and even in to some of the abandoned structures.The music coupled with the music is probably the most haunting thing about the game. Well after the game was over I was left feeling the pull that the two together caused on me. The voice acting was also well crafted. There were secrets and bits of story that made you want to discover all there was about the island.The controls are VERY straightforward, use the mouse as your camera, and use WASD to walk.I don't want to give too much away, but I will tell you this there will be disappointment when you find yourself at the end of the game, and it will be sudden. Part of you will know immediately where this story will end, but you will be able to shrug it off until the final moment. You will learn stories of Esther, Paul, a Hermit, a man named Donnelly, and a herder named Jakobson. You will find that you yearn for more, but the sad reality is this is truly a walk through this island, a story is told, and then the end occurs. You do NOTHING other than walk to the designated spots to trigger the next bit of dialogue. So as good as the experience is, unless you are really really interested in taking a walk through something mysterious, you are going to find the 30 minutes it takes from start to finish is going to leave you in an interesting position.So would I recommend this to people? Well I'd say if you are interested in being caught up in imagery and a bit of story, then sure. There's nothing here to really consider this a game, per say, even though you do interact with it, I would have to say its more of an interactive art piece. So if I look at that I have to give this an 8.1 out of 10.",

    "review_description": "Good reader, I am told you like games with a challenge! Therefore, I shall issue one to you! I suggest to you that you shall play... Super Mario Bros.! Wait, this be not a true challenge. The stakes need be raised. I must also demand that you shall play the game while your youngest daughter is grabbing the controller out of your hands, the dog is kicking the television over, and your spouse is leaned up against your ear saying \"buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz squirrel buzz\" repeatedly as you play. Truly, a challenge!…No? Why not?A lot of us deliberately seek out harder games - there's a special satisfaction about working hard at something, failing it repeatedly, and eventually overcoming it. But we usually define a challenge as something that's difficult to complete, not something that's difficult to play. For example, in that last space shooter game I reviewed, the game had no mini-map telling me where my main targets were. This made the game \"harder\" in that I couldn't finish a mission until I'd spent effort hunting the things down. That game was also hard when I was flying down the edge of a humongous space cruiser with several laser turrets aiming on me and I needed to figure out the tactics for hitting my targets without getting killed. One of these things was fun, while the other just felt like a nuisance. I can't come up with the exact words I want here - something about how we want to beat the level, not beat the game.The sad part for No Time To Explain is that it didn't even mean to be a challenging game. Its intentions start with the title - you load the game and a guy crashes into your home, shouting, \"Come with me! No time to explain!\" He is then dragged off by a crab monster, and you pick up his gun and run after him. The game's thesis statement is its humor, which is a good joke for a while as you navigate jumping puzzles to reach the futuristic guy being devoured just offscreen by a slow-chewing shark. The game goes on to throw an array of goofy monsters and absurd dialogue at you. It's a cute joke for the most part.But as for the game surrounding that joke? Right after I leave the house, I find that my little guy doesn't jump very high. In order to clear most barriers and gaps, I have to fire my laser in the opposite direction, using the recoil to push me past things. The game takes this One Neat Idea and applies it to nearly every jump in the game, requiring the laser boost for every moment you leave the ground. This starts a litany of issues.Problem one, you fire the gun with the mouse, moving your cursor in a direction you want to aim and pressing the mouse button to shoot. This means that moving your mouse \"up\" doesn't always mean your character will be shooting \"up\" unless the cursor is over his head. Let's say I'm jumping across a gap, so I point my mouse somewhere to the 8 o'clock angle of my character and fire, giving me a recoil boost in the opposite vector at 2 o'clock. However, as my guy jumps, he goes higher along the y-axis of the screen. If I do not also move my mouse in the exact same vertical motion, then the angle with the cursor changes, so the angle of the boost vector also becomes more vertical. This gets even worse when you reach the edge of a map, and your guy who was in the center of the screen as it scrolled is now on the far side of the screen, changing the boost vector even more.I think I just lost seven of my thirteen regular readers with that mathy explanation. Basically, it is very difficult to make precise jumps with your laser boost because you can't steady the direction of propulsion.Problem two, the laser is a heavy weapon with enough power to shove you in the opposite direction. The game provides a subtle hint of the weapon's power by making the screen shake as you fire it. This is a common game mechanic - when you're playing Call of Duty and a rocket explodes right next to you, the screen shakes, right? Same idea - heavy weapon equals shaky screen. Did I just say that nearly every jump requires use of the gun? Yes, and that means that you have to make every precise jump onto a tiny platform while the screen is shaking.By the way, the gun isn't the only thing shaking the screen. Fight a mini-boss that tunnels through the ground, he shakes the world with him. On the final level, a factory with chemistry machines bubbling in the background, you get regular intervals of screen shake to add that level of, uh, chemistry atmosphere. Playing this game was starting to hurt - there's got to be some horrible abuse done to your attention span when everything you look at is having a seizure.Also, the game engine. I fear the game may have been designed in Flash or something equally noncomprehensive, because I suffered with a lot of chugging framerates. I don't have the most up-to-date PC setup here, but I don't expect a game to start dropping frames just because there are blocks falling from the top of the screen during a boss fight. On a racing stage where my guy is running from an evil man in a robot sphere, he falls through solid platforms. A mole boss with lasers occasionally gets stuck in the ground if I'm not standing in front of him (the animation waits for a map change that never comes). A bit more QA time might have been reasonable.As with other modern indie platformers, beating each level requires a certain amount of precision. Guess how precise you can be while your weapon is shaking the screen, the environment is shaking the screen more, your mouse position is changing as you move, and the framerate is crawling? Trick question, obviously. The reason I was able to progress at all is that none of the levels posed too much challenge. With under four hours to clear the main playthrough, the game didn't last long enough to get into anything harder. Though it did last long enough for me to hate gigantic laser-drill mole monsters.There is humor in No Time To Explain, and it's all right, but after a few hours of staring at shaky, stop-motion pixels, I had a hard time focusing on the funny parts. This game feels less like a full Steam release and more like a student project rushed to meet the professor's deadline.",

    "review_description": "TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge is a love letter to fans of the original 1987 cartoon series as well as the ‘90s beat ‘em up video games but mostly does enough to appeal to new players alike.But, let’s not kid ourselves here. This game’s core audience are those of us who were children of the eighties and nineties and have fond memories of that initial cartoon and the subsequent games it inspired. Those that know their Knuckleheads from their Mousers, their Baxter Stockman’s from their Rat King’s – that type. The developers Tribute Games (some worked on Scott Pilgrim Vs The World: The Game) and publishers Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4) have admitted in developer diaries of being in that very group and how passionate they were to recreate that particular aesthetic with the flourishes and life improvements afforded by modern gaming standards.If you have played those old games or the more recent releases which homage the genre, then you know what to expect. Choose your playable character from a choice of six (with one further unlockable) and side-scroll your way through sixteen colourful levels pummelling different variations of Shredder’s foot clan and all sorts of other enemy types. At the end of each stage you fight a boss – or occasionally mid-stage – and these will be familiar to any TMNT fan but with a couple newly created ones specifically for this game to shake things up.Similar to previous instalments, the character abilities are divided between three traits: speed, power and range, with each fighter statistics spread across each. Do you go for Donatello with his long reaching bo-staff but suffer in the speed category, or Raphael with his puny twin sai reach but much more powerful attacks? I personally tend to go for Leonardo for his completely even skill set and his straight no-nonsense delivery. Having Splinter and April O’Neil included also helps mix it up and adds a much fresher feel considering they have never been available previously.April instantly regretted asking the turtles to visit the officeBuilding from the older SNES era controls and merged with the refreshing combo system from Streets of Rage 4, Tribute Games have wonderfully finessed the mechanics with simplicity and depth in equal measure. You have one main attack button but a myriad of ways it can be used including a four-string combo attack, jumping attack, back-attack, throws and many others which means mixing up your offence in the midst of skirmishes is the key to getting through the game’s many levels unscathed. There are also a few special attacks which are unique to each character and can be summoned whenever the Special Meter is filled (which can also be stacked and saved for bosses if preferred). Environmental attacks from the previous versions return with many moments you can time your button press to knock enemies senseless with a water hydrant or street lights, as well as use the classic Pizza Power Up to spin around and clobber entire groups of baddies.Helpfully, there is a 21 page training section which handily takes you through the arsenal at your disposal and as lengthy as that sounds it is completely optional and brisk enough to check out. Crucially, the amount of options coupled with the slide mechanic for fast manoeuvrability and combo system allow the game satisfying depth and repetition doesn’t set in too often because the action moves and plays swiftly to keep things interesting.Like any worthwhile beat ‘em-up, each of the enemies have different weapons and attack patterns and some require you to alter yours (for example, some dodge straight attacks and instead punish you so you have to slide in to surprise them whereas others with weapons require a timed attack after they have swung). With so many variations of enemies it does keep things engaging and likewise for the boss fights. Each one has a distinct pattern and the skill is in working it out and striking at the right moments. However, some of these encounters are where this game can be tricky. Several boss fights will frustrate you but mostly it can be down to player error although occasionally the difficulty and actual length of these fights can get a little tiresome.Tribute Games have really delved into the cartoon series and plucked everything from side characters (April’s news team colleagues or the Mutant Punk Frogs) to locales for level designs. The Mike Patton (Faith No More) version of the cartoon series theme song as the pre-titles introduction is the clear statement of intent. The glorious art design also reflects this version of the Turtles instead of the pre-school-looking current Nickelodeon style. The in-game character sprites have a retro pixelated vibe and resemble up-scaled Game Boy Advance models, which works well for the tone. The backgrounds too are an abundance of colour and feature gorgeous parallax scrolling, with levels ranging from the Foot Clan-overrun Channel 6 News studio, arcade malls, New York streets to many others from the series such as the classic Technodrome and Dimension X.Bebop was never the most accurate shotThe Story Mode allows each stage to be played with your limited amount of lives replenishing per level and includes bonus collectables, unique challenges and story art-scenes at the completion of each one. It’s the main mode of the game and even features a Super Mario World-style world map with the Turtles van acting as your icon for selecting a level which is adorable and a neat touch from the developers. It will only take you around three hours to complete which is admittedly a little short but there is enough in-game challenges and achievements to give it lasting appeal. The classic Arcade Mode is also available for those that want the proper challenge of beating the game with a set amount of Continues and with three difficulty settings there is plenty to keep players busy to master it fully.However, Story Mode includes a progression system which allows you to upgrade all of the playable fighters to a maximum level ten and with each incremental increase your character gains extra hit points, lives, additional super attacks and a few other neat improvements which ultimately rewards repeat playthroughs of the campaign with each character. This is not something that you could say about the traditional brawler game and it’s these little RPG enhancements which Tribute Games have added to give tonnes more replayability.Additionally, as much fun as this game is on single-player, it really comes alive online. And to dial up the frenetic action, Tribute Games have provided six-player co-op functionality. This changes the nature of the game as with the added players comes more enemies on screen and with that a ludicrous amount of combos that it resembles a cartoon dust cloud of limbs and Foot Clan bodies. It’s supposed to be balanced and I can’t tell which difficulty the matches I have joined have been on but it seems dramatically easier playing with a group. But – vitally- more fun. And connecting on the Switch has been effortless as there are currently always games to join but there have been a fair few which have ended abruptly due to server disconnection (though, difficult to know what caused it). Yet, for the most part, the online has been an absolute blast and the frame rate has remained smooth which has helped immensely.There are a few niggles which I feel could have improved things slightly. In the Story Mode, I have selected the easiest setting of Chill but if I want to play it through on the next two difficulty settings I need to restart the whole thing and lose all of my progress (including challenge completion and timing records) which I am not keen to do. I feel it shouldn’t have been so difficult to allow me to switch the difficulty and have separate records and progress for each setting.Poor Bob was due to retire soon from the Foot Clan tooThere are moments in combat where I wish there was a block ability as there are so many times you will be ganged up on by groups of enemies but are mid combo so not able to interrupt and parry like in the Batman Arkham games. It’s not something these games have had before – maybe too radical to introduce in a two-dimentional beat ‘em up – and go against the nostalgia aspect but it definitely became a recurring thought as I was routinely knocked senseless for misjudging a surprise attack.Additionally, the music is mostly catchy and serves its purpose but the mixture of the jaunty beats with hip hop artists rapping over it somehow doesn’t feel as symbiotic as the creators intended and I admittedly pine for the absolutely stellar 16-bit simplicity of the Turtles In Time soundtrack. Again, not a major issue and definitely personal preference on this one – but on listening to both whilst writing this review has reaffirmed my appreciation for that classic Konami score.The creative minds at Tribute Games and Dotemu have excelled in other ways though as the actual humour and personality of the television series and classic games has been marvellously rekindled. Stages begin with characters like Bebop and Rocksteady mingling about but then comically darting off screen as the Turtles appear or Foot Clan soldiers will be wearing chef’s outfits and seemingly baking cakes – you get the impression the Turtles are a nuisance for ruining their productivity – before throwing ninja stars at you. The voice talent returning from the cartoon show is an incredible feat and mostly sound terrific (if occasionally a little older and sometimes muffled). Each character has their own distinct taunt move and all are adorably animated (April thrusts out a microphone asking for a comment, Michelangelo chicken dances with his nunchucks and an excitable ‘Party dude!’).Verdict – The attention to detail is remarkable that only the most cynical of players will not warm to its bouncy charm. Tribute Games have done a remarkable job to bring the franchise back to its roots and bolted on a tonne of modern enhancements to make it enjoyable for all gamers. There are some areas where it could be slightly tightened like the occasional boss battle length or ability to change Story Mode difficulty but otherwise it’s a pure blast of nostalgic joy from start screen to end credits. It may be fan service dialled to extreme heights but when it’s this well delivered, it’s difficult to complain.",

    "review_description": " I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up Downwell for $3.49; it looked fine enough for a cheap game, and it appeared to be an arcade-like fling that would make for some quick fun in the same vein as Luftrausers. I certainly wasn't expecting a fast, challenging twitch shooter that has a surprising amount of depth for a game about falling down a hole while firing off gunboots. If gunboots doesn't have you sold right away, I'm not sure anything else will.This is the story about a boy's terrible decision.Downwell is a platforming shooter where you'll spend most of your time descending deep down into said well, encountering enemies that you either have to stomp on or shoot while collecting gems to buy power-ups. As you descend through the procedurally generated levels you'll come across throngs of enemies that can be shot, stomped or have an invulnerability to one or the other. Your gunboots start off as a basic little pea shooter with a small magazine, but stomping something, like an enemy or torch, or landing on solid ground will reload your magazine, though reloading can also be achieved through upgrades awarded to you upon level completion (which I'll get to shortly). The graphics lend themselves quite nicely to the fast paced nature of the game, their chunky Commodore 64 style allows you to see incoming obstacles clearly and react accordingly, since enemies are easily discernable between one another, and the color scheme only further helps differentiate what's bad and what's safe. For example, the default color palette has your character and stompable enemies colored solid white, while gems and hazardous things to touch are colored a stark red in contrast. This means that even when you reach new level sets with new hazards, it's quite easy to deduce what can or cannot be stomped, like sharp coral or fiery ghosts. You can unlock more palettes upon death or game completion when your collected gems are tallied up towards a milestone goal, but many of the color schemes are horrifically garish, some of them downright painful to look at.A lot of these color palettes are oppressive to the eyes.Your character's movement is borderline perfect with enough loose floatiness to your jumps, while firing your gunboots provides sharp, sudden control when needing to redirect yourself in a hurry. You'll come across side rooms during your descent which will contain either a shop to spend your gems for health and extra gunboot magazine charges, a room with a pile of gems for the taking, or a room that contains gun modules that will give you a point of health or some charges in addition to changing your gun type. There are a handful of gun types that you can obtain but you can only use one at a time, ranging from a beefy machine gun to a vicious laser which can grow stronger if you collect enough gems to reach a 'gem high', a multiplier/enhanced character state where your gunboots are super charged, doing more damage and having larger bullets depending on the weapon currently equipped. Each gun type also has different attributes for the kickback received, jolting you up which can often mean the difference between stomping an enemy and taking damage. You can also go for combos, where you're rewarded with bonus gems, health and charges for killing multiple enemies in a row without landing on solid ground - excluding ground connected to a side room. Then there are upgrades you can choose from at the end of each level, which include your stomps becoming explosive, your character being put into a time stopping bubble upon taking damage, becoming able to consume corpses for extra health and more.The spread module is great for suppressing fire, but don't expect much stopping power from it.While the number of gun types and end of level upgrades aren't very numerous, this means it doesn't take long until you know exactly what you're doing and what upgrades to immediately shoot for to tackle the challenges each level brings. Your play style probably won't vary with each new run since death is very likely, and you generally are stuck playing in the same ways; you may play cautiously, focus on avoiding ground as much as possible in order to rack up combos, go completely Rambo and brute force your way, or a hybrid of tactics depending on what the situation is. While other rogue-lites suffer from the issue of getting 'lucky' and having a superb run due to a lone item that makes your character overpowered, Downwell manages to avoid this folly by having character upgrades be incredibly useful in their own ways, not just flatout game breakers - Not to mention the game relies on quick, twitchy reactions and raw playing skill, which is a breath of fresh air. The jetpack is great for when you unload a full magazine and need to save yourself, but it can run out of fuel until you land on something again. The drone may be a great buddy to have for fire support, but it can kill the very enemy you were hoping to stomp on to reload your gunboots.The amount of player skill that Downwell demands while also supplying a surprising amount of depth is astounding for such a little game, and it's all punctuated by being able to restart a failed run in no time at all.What's frustrating is that my only real complaint about Downwell is that sometimes hit detection between the player character and enemies can sometimes be a bit unreliable, especially when coming at them from an angle. Besides that, the game's brevity lends itself miles, not padding itself out with any filler or needless content that keeps you from getting right to the next level and making the big plays. Downwell is cheap, fast, fun and challenging, and at the time of writing this there is talk of the game also getting free updates. Such a little game offering so much enjoyment makes Downwell an absolute treat to romp through and I cannot recommend it enough to those wanting a new rogue-lite fix.",

    "review_description": "Downwell is a game that offers much more than meets the eye. On its face, this game looks pretty simple. You control a nameless character, swiftly and unflinchingly traversing down a well, killing anything in your way with the help of your trusty gunboots and bouncing off of enemies.That’s basically all the game gives you at the outset. But the game’s simpler, retro aesthetic belies a level of depth and intelligence to Downwell’s design. The game has no tutorials to ease you into the game’s feature set; it lets you figure the game out at your own pace. And it is imperative that learn the game’s rules pretty quickly because the game is hard as hell. Your character has a limited number of hit points, and getting through the increasingly hectic deluge of monsters out to get you unscathed while navigating the randomly generated levels is a rare luxury. The ordeal is made all the more strenuous by the limitations on your gunboots. You have very little charge (the game's speak for ammo) at the start of each run in Downwell, so you have to have some reservations about what you shoot. You can refill your ammo in two ways: bouncing off of enemies or landing on solid ground. While landing on platforms and cliffs at every opportunity is tempting, Downwell incentivizes playing with speed through its combo system, which only lasts as long as you stay off the ground. The longer the combo, the more gems and health you will receive when the combo eventually ends. This encourages the player to play Downwell at breakneck speed, which is good since this is where the game shines at its absolute brightest. Downwell’s difficulty is clear, but it never feels unfair. The game gives you the tools to succeed, and rewards persistence and good play at all times. The controls are tight and responsive, especially on the Vita (shout-out to the four people who bought a Vita). The propulsive jolt of your gunboots gives your character a slight boost into the air, giving you a quick moment to avoid, or attack, whatever is in your path. The gems you acquire as you descend down the well act as currency in shops, where you can buy health packs or increases to your charge capacity. There are also small caves where you can find additional gems as well as one of the game’s different weapon types. These helpful enclaves are covered by a time-stopping bubble that gives you a reprieve from the various dangers surrounding you, as well as an opportunity to plan the next few seconds of your descent. At the end of each level, you can augment your character with a variety of upgrades such as increasing the range and accuracy of your gunboots, creating explosions every time you stomp on an enemy, or getting discounts in the shops.\"What are you buying?\" Even in death, Downwell provides a form of progress. All of your gems contribute to a leveling system that unlocks dozens of color palettes to change the color scheme of the game, and five different play styles. These styles all involve a trade-off of some kind, besides the standard character you start with. You can start with more hit points, but you have fewer upgrade options at the end of levels. You can find gun modules more regularly, but shops will become a rarer occurrence. These different play styles mostly adhere to the game’s standard formula, but the changes they do make add variety and a level of personal customization over how you play the game.One of the many palettes you unlock as you play. Downwell is a game that continually keeps you on your toes. The pace of the game combined with a lack of any sort of tutorial can, initially, make the game a slightly jarring experience. But the game is still really fun from the outset, and it doesn't obfuscate how to get better. This game has made late nights later, and lunch breaks seem shorter than they used to be. Just one more game. Just one more game. If that’s not a mark of quality, I don’t know what is.",

    "review_description": "Downwell is a dastardly hard platforming shmup rogue-lite.Instead of heading left-to-right shooting enemies in your way, you're tumbling down a seemingly endless well with platforms, enemies, hazards, and holes in the wall that contain weapons, gems, or shops with only the ability to run, jump, and multi-jump while shooting shots directly below you. Enemies, objects, and gem blocks drop gems that can be used purchase items and upgrades at stores and count to your overall score. Downwell communicates in a visual style of only three colors, black, white, and red. Black being used for the background and sprite detail, white being the main color of objects and enemies, and red being the color of gems or hazards. So for example, an enemy that is white can be jumped on or shot at, but can hurt you if you touch them. A red enemy will hurt you if you touch them, but can be shot. A enemy with both can be touched on the white part of their body. This color pallete can be changed to a variety of sets that are unlocked as you lose runs and accrue points based on your gems over time.You have low health, and a few options for your character style, such as a player with floater jumps, or a player with more health, but less upgrade options upon ending a level. After ending a level, you're usually given three choices of upgrades (more or less depending on your Style or upgrades) such as health refills, an extra jump when you run out of charges, the ability to heal by eating the bodies of enemies, or extra upgrade choices in future level completions. Caves found on either side of the well can contain piles of gems, shops, or a new weapon that will change your weapon as well as either heal you or upgrade your charges by a point or two.Downwell is both easy to understand and hard to complete.Most enemies are easy to kill and controls are fluid and responsive enough to blame you exclusively for failure. But you also have low health, extremely rare chances to upgrade health (every time I saw Curry to increase my health, i was short one or two hundred gems) and little room for error as touching an enemy on the part of it that can hurt you, vs it's weak spot, or being swarmed by enemies where a red enemy will hurt you right as you run out of shots to hurt it and jump to avoid it. Add to that, healing is infrequent and I found alot of my deaths due to being hammered by bad moments all at ounce, and this game is really tough. I've played for 7 hours total and I've only maybe had one run that gets past the second, Catacomb world (the Caverns?). Downwell is extremely fun to play, but this lack of progress for such a long time keeps me from wanting to finish. Oh, and there is apparently a hard mode since this game is apparently not hard enough for some people.Downwell is an excellent and novel rogue-lite, but expect frustration if you don't have perfect execution.",

    "review_description": "I've found myself confused multiple times in this game, and I couldn't be happier. It's a puzzle game that is both mysterious in it's nature, but also very challenging. You'll find yourself scratching your every level saying things like \"there's no way I can get there\" or \"uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhh\" and not be angry in the least about it. The Bridge is a satisfying gravity shifting puzzle game that I would easily recommend to indie game lovers and puzzle game lovers alike. It's got innovative gaming mechanics, beautiful hand-drawn art and some really calming music.For more, check out my First Impressions video.",

    "review_description": "(Originally published on gameverse.com on March 5th, 2013: Link)Gameplay VideoThere are not many games that capture an atmosphere and play to its strengths in the way that The Bridge does. The hand-drawn world is fairly evocative of M.C. Escher’s creations, although the puzzle designs and elaborate backgrounds do well to distinguish The Bridge with its own style.Created by a two-man team of artist Mario Castañeda and designer/programmer Ty Taylor, The Bridge introduces players to a number of mind-bending 2D logic puzzles that will leave players challenged by their interpretations of space and rewarded after the completion of each level.Where the game truly succeeds is in its unification of a radical art style and a unique design philosophy. The game gradually progresses players through its four different chapters that span 24 levels. Introductory mechanics are relatively simple, but newer additions add a higher yet still accessible degree of difficulty as the game goes on.Gamers of all types should be able to enjoy The Bridge, despite some difficulty spikes later on in the main portion of the game. Levels do not take long to complete once the solution has been figured out and the variety of problems to be solved keep each area feeling fresh. The Bridge has never made me so happy to be confused — I enjoyed the myriad of ways you need to think outside the box in order to complete a level, especially when accompanied by a slew of gorgeous art pieces.As great as the design and art style are, one of the few negative aspects of the game is in regards to the slow pace of the gameplay. This is mostly symptomatic of the design and is easily forgivable for many levels in the game. However, there are times in which the player will know how to finish a puzzle but has to patiently navigate their way to the end. I also encountered a few issues where restarting or rewinding became time-intensive, but that will vary based on the player’s ability to solveThe Bridge’s puzzles.Overall, The Bridge presents players with a challenging series of puzzles chock full of eye candy. Even inexperienced gamers will be able to take on the game and come away successful, and completing each puzzle feels mentally satisfying. The atmosphere, sound, and puzzle design are all incredibly engaging and stimulating. The Bridge also offers replayability in the form of “mirrored” levels after completion of the initial 24 puzzles, adding new mechanics and a layer of complexity that will keep players engaged for hours. I would highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a unique take on art in games and the puzzle genre as a whole.The Bridge is available now on Steam for $14.99, a bargain for the content included in the game.

    "review_description": "Sanctum is by now means a bad game but it's not really a good game either. The multiplayer is a big plus for me being able to play with a friend. But Sanctum simply lacks content and at times feel likes one of the java browser tower defense games out there just in 3D.It has the same ridiculous damage and creep life increasing. There's mostly only one \"good\" way to solve the maps and there are only 4 maps, 3 weapons and 4-5 towers coming with the game. There's more content if you're willing to pay for it. The developer decided to squeeze as much money out of the players as possible, charging you for even the tiniest bit of additional content.In retro perspective I wouldn't buy Sanctum again. Especially not with much better games like \"Orcs Must Die!\" or \"Dungeon Defenders\" on the market.",

    "review_description": "I guess I’ve been in a bit of a tower defense mood as of late, especially with Dungeon Defenders and Orcs Must Die just over the horizon. So when I saw a Tower Defense/Strategy pack on sale on Steam last week I rather impulsively bought it. The pack had 5 games and included Defense Grid, which I have on XBLA, and Santcum, a title I saw not too long ago in a Quick Look over on Giantbomb. I liked the look of it and thought it might be a fun game to take my mind off of the slew of October releases.My computer is rather dated, and beginning to show it in performance, so I was very apprehensive about how well it would function. Luckily for me the game performs very well even on old machines. The game has a very clean look both in environments and mobs as well as the interface. The graphics aren’t the highest of quality, though some of the blame could be my need for medium settings, but it looks good in its simplicity.The gameplay is divided into two parts, much like Dungeon Defenders, where you enter a build phase to place structures and a combat phase where you get down and dirty with your own weapons. During the build phase there are two components: Building the path and placing the structures. What I really like about Sanctum that I haven’t seen in too many other TD games is that you get to shape the path the mobs take at your own discretion. Each level starts off with a bit of currency and a flat/empty space, without any obstacles, and you get to place blocks on any empty square. These blocks, that form the path, are also necessary because structures can only be built on blocks. Once you’ve shaped the path with blocks you’ll set out to arm them with the standard turret/structure types you’ve come to expect from a TD game: rapid fire/low damage, high damage/slow fire, AoE, anti-air, etc., nothing groundbreaking though relatively well-balanced. I found the anti-air guns to be rather lacking in power because air units will always pose a bigger threat than any ground unit. Each turret can be upgraded 5 times (to level 6) and like with most of these games, upgrading is usually better than adding more turrets even with the slightly increased cost. Also, I don’t know what exactly determines how much currency you get at the end of each level, possibly static returns or it may change with difficulty.Once you’ve finished the build phase you’ll enter the combat phase and trigger the enemies, at which time you will be unable to build any more structures. Depending on the map they’ll come at you from 1 or more different areas so deciding how to shape the enemies won’t just improve exposure to turrets, but also give you advantageous positions to shoot from. Shooting from ground level isn’t always a great idea because if you come into contact with an enemy you’ll get knocked around and will be unable to act for a few seconds. You’ll have access to 3 weapons: Assault, Sniper, Freeze; and I assume their functions are obvious. Each of the weapons, like the turrets, can be upgraded and will get much more powerful. I found that I spent most of my time with the sniper because when it’s maxed out it’s really the most useful. I also use the freeze gun between rounds on the sniper, but I rarely ever put points into upgrading it. The assault rifle isn’t all that good except for a few select enemy types where its secondary fire, a contact grenade, is very useful.In addition to the basic “campaign”, in which each level will take about 1 hour, you can turn on survival mode for each of the maps which changes up the order and amount of enemies increasing the difficulty from the get-go. For even more gameplay there are a few DLC items that were recently realeased, as well as a free update/expansion, that will give you access to new maps, a shotgun, and 5 more structures including: mines, slow fields, weapon amplifier, anti-air/ground unit, and a piercing/multi-target turret. Sanctum is available on Steam for $9.99 and another $6.25 for all the DLC.For $10-17 it really is a great deal. With solid gameplay, a strong strategy element, a challenging survival mode (for each map), there’s a lot of value to be found in Sanctum. Like most strategy games of the type it can become very addicting, always retrying levels to win with 100% node health and trying to get some of the more unique Steam achievements like using only one type of turret or killing X number of enemies with a certain weapon, etc. Co-op is also available supporting up to 4 people, but I only know 2 people on Steam and neither of them have Sanctum; and I don’t usually like playing with complete strangers so I can’t comment on the differences between SP and Co-op. I’d assume the differences would be scaled mob numbers with the number of players.If you enjoyed this review please check out my blog at Ramblings of a MAD Man where you'll find more reviews (with images and video) and news posts with lots of trailers and info to enjoy.",

    "review_description": "Easy use of the Kinect tag-line aside, this very concept is at the core of Sanctum's gameplay. Combining tower defense with first person shooting, Sanctum comes in along with Dungeon Defenders, Orcs Must Die! and Iron Brigade where they try doing more stranger experimenting with what can be done in the genre. However where Sanctum's problem lies in that while it is doing something fresh and not commonly seen, the very heart of it is just \"decent\" and that it's not really exciting and yet it won't waste your time. If you're looking for something in this space to entertain, I'd suggest others but even then, Sanctum's not the worst you can do.The \"plot\" of Sanctum is simple: you play as Skye attempting to save a core from a race of weird looking aliens from destroying it. And that's pretty much it, while Skye herself is a cool design and the aliens are bizarre yet neat-looking, that isn't what you play this game for. You play for the numbers as you see your towers taking down the invading foes and spending them on more towers. These structures can range from anti-air, mortars, gatling guns, lightning towers and elevation blocks that help you stand on the turrets and not in the lane. What makes it unique is that you can actually build your own pathways and contribute to the action.During the building phase, Skye can place, upgrade or sell the structures or her weapons to have a bit more punch. Once you're ready, you can freely run away and help contribute to winning that initial wave such as sniping the big aliens, using the assault rifle to dump into a huge crowd of dudes or using the freeze gun to either slow down or completely stop them from moving. The problem is that the gunplay is mediocre and a bit unsatisfying and while guns never run out of ammo, the importance of aim and reloading and using the right guns feel muted as the \"oh crap oh crap!\" moments commonly found in the genre kind of make it trivial. While the game does get progressively harder, your presence can at once feel like you don't need to contribute but it's certainly beneficial to do so.The game does have co-op with a server browser and one thing I found which is arguably one of the best yet little-seen additions to a game: the chat functionality has a built in text-to-speech system. Similar to other programs available online, saying anything in chat brings that male robotic voice with the stilted delivery saying your lines which not only lightens up the proceedings when you say random things (or sing Don't Stop Believing as one group did) but makes one feel to swear excessively. The old adage of \"it's more funner in co-op\" is certainly true here but without a feeling of progression and limited games in the servers, I don't know the longevity of the game, despite 2 map packs...which might explain the lack of games on the servers but not willing to put money down to double check.Despite at one point being updated what felt like 4 times a week, Dungeon Defenders is arguably one of the better blending of genres when it comes down to tower defense. Which isn't to say Sanctum's horrible as it is competently made with a nice soundtrack but I'm not sure if full price is the way to go.",

    "review_description": "Kao Round 2 is a Polish 3D platformer from the PS2 era. The character is a little kangaroo man with boxing gloves, which isn't exactly inspired but whatever. It \"borrows\" a lot of stuff from Rayman 2 and a little bit from Crash Bandicoot. Kao isn't the bottom of the mascot barrel, but he's decidedly below average.The plot has Kao rescuing his animal friends, who have all been captured by The Hunter because he's mean and likes to do that. You do spend plenty of time rescuing animals, but you're also attacked by acid spitting spiders and giant fish. Are these guys in league with The Hunter? Why doesn't he want to capture them? You might say I'm thinking about this too much, but the boss of the underwater world is specifically name-checked as a collaborator. Also, for some reason a lot of The Hunter's thugs seem to be dwarves and I don't know why.Dwarf Where Kao 2 really falls apart are the controls. They aren't tragically bad like in a Bubsy 3D, but his turning radius and responsiveness are very poor. You'd think a game about a kangaroo with boxing gloves would focus on punching things, but combat is the worst. Punching kills Kao's momentum and collision detection for all attacks is unforgiving. The stop-and-start tempo makes even the reliably enjoyable id act of smashing a bunch of crates to collect money feel like a chore. Your best option for all combat is the ranged boomerang throw, but boomerang ammunition is limited and only provided when the level designers allow it.Game design decorum is broken quite often. Enemy attacks and things like crumbling platforms are very poorly telegraphed. Crash-style 'run towards the camera' levels move too fast for you to be able to react to oncoming obstacles in time, requiring a ton of trial and error. Overall readability is not well done. For one example, some bodies of water will kill Kao instantly upon contact, while some he can walk through just fine even though they are visually indistinct. The method for fighting the boss of the first world is so poorly conveyed that I had to look up a guide. Fortunately, failure is usually very forgiving. Kao has a long health bar, infinite lives, and frequent checkpoints. However, this doesn't mitigate the frustration of being killed over and over again by blind 'gotcha' traps. Kao 2 is very short. I beat it in two sittings, with a total 3 hour playtime. I think it goes for about $1.79 usd on your average Steam sale, which I'd say is the right price.",

    "review_description": "I'm sort of a closet point-and-click-puzzle game lover. I've really played very little in the genre, in fact, the only one that comes to mind right now was Axel & Pixel which I played on my Xbox 360. That being said, I'm constantly looking for other games like this that I might be able to get in to, for me the real hurdle was the price (same reason I haven't gotten Machinarium quite yet).I was surprised to beat this game in under three hours (Steam lists 2 hours played, but I did play the demo first), especially since the first level took up at least a full hour. I think the $13.50 spent on the game was well worth it, though if I were to recommend it to friends I might advise them to possibly wait for a bigger sale later in the year.It was incredibly satisfying to collect the puzzle pieces throughout the chapters and assemble them at the end of each, I would love to see DLC for this game adding more to this mechanic. Overall I think the puzzles in this game were made directly for me: some were easy but incredibly satisfying to solve (the ripped portrait, colored ball circles, rotating colored light bulbs), some required a lot of trial and error, and some were even downright impossible-seeming but I ended up getting through them (world map venn diagram, both pipe puzzles). Oh but I did hate the retro-style video game sequences, so slow and annoying! :)I really hope the developers are seeing good returns on this game and I hope they put a portion of that to expanding it further, either with a sequel or small (low price) chunks of DLC expanding the game. I would love to see a narrative thread tacked on to this with the same art style done with sequential panels (imagine a motion comic between chapters).    ",

    "review_description": "Mirror post of my on-site review.Puzzle Agent 2, Telltale Games' sequel to its well-received Puzzle Agent, released last year, is an extended and entertaining continuation of the first game's story and gameplay. While it doesn't do a ton of new and exciting things with the formula, it continues where the first left off with a wildly entertaining storyline, some great mind-boggling puzzles, and an overarching mystery that will keep you going \"Huh...What?!\" until the end. It also improves on a handful of key elements and manages to do everything in a fresh manner, keeping players entertained throughout.Puzzle Agent 2 opens, more or less, where the previous game left off, with Agent Tethers confused and uneasy about his last case's premature closure. Delegating the work of transcribing his evidence tapes to his coworker in the vegetable crimes department of the FBI, he takes a personal leave back to Scoggins, to finally figure out what is going on, once and for all. Many of the original cast members are back for round two, and they all seem to have different reactions to Tethers' return, setting up a great theme for the game that keeps you wondering who is actually on your side. A handful of new characters are introduced, adding personality and mystery to Scoggins, and giving some new faces for existing players to get to know. The story ends up twisting and turning in a manner tha keeps you guessing whether the town of Scoggins is going mad, or if Tethers himself is beginning to lose is grip as well. Much of the structure of the game sticks to the previous game's formula, but does so in a manner that flows much more nicely than the first game had executed it. As far as continuity goes, storyline nitpickers will probably have a hayday with the fiction, as there are plenty of plot holes and red herrings, but in the context of gameplay, it manages to focus your attention properly so much of this doesn't even seem important enough to bother questioning. It's also light hearted and goofy enough that story could be somewhat sacrificed for the overall humor and enjoyment.This second game in the Puzzle Agent franchise does a good job of sharpening up and cleaning up many menu elements and graphics, and while the actual menu system isn't inherently changed, much of it seems smoother and cleaner in animation. The actual character animation and artstyle continues its rough layout and design, but rarely becomes something that a player could honestly complain about. It can be nitpicked as lazy art direction, but the pacing and style of the game actually lend themselves to the choppy animation style that the game employs. That said, the general look of the game does seem much cleaner and crisper than the first game, lending it a much more consistent and overall better look than its predecessor. The sound also makes a grand return, with excellent music direction and great voice acting that rarely disappoints. There continues to be a lot of faux-horror segments that would fall flat on thier own, but the sound design and musical themes put in place make them several times more tense.The actual puzzles in Puzzle Agent 2 require some considerable praise, as I had originally expected to see a lot of replays of old puzzles from the first game. While there are obviously callbacks to the puzzles introduced there, there is both enough deviation from those source puzzles that they remain interesting, and enough brand new puzzles to make it less obvious that those puzzles are even there. The final puzzle of this sequel seems to directly pull from the style of the first game's final puzzle, but the actual theme of the puzzle is so different, some may not even notice. Overall, however, the side puzzles seem to have been increased, giving more reason to click around the areas. They still don't give any reward other than overall puzzle rating, though, but it's hard to imagine full side stories occuring in such a game. A small annoyance I had with the previous game was the perceived lack of a way to get back into the game for previously missed or completed puzzles at the end of the game. Telltale apparently got enough complaints about this to go on and add in a small hub from which you can access any puzzles of this sort, giving you no reason to regret completing the game without searching every nook and cranny.In comparison to Telltale's previous puzzle adventure game, Puzzle Agent 2 hits a lot of high notes much more strikingly, and manages to can up the entire storyline into a pretty satisfying finale that will make you glad you went through it all. While it's hard to say that this sequel does anything outrageous compared to its roots, those roots were already doing things so well it would really be hard to top. The level of polish added this time around is well worth buying the sequel, and left me ready for a sequel with the open-ended finale.",

    "review_description": "To put it briefly, Puzzle Agent 2 is a collection of puzzles which are wrapped in a striking, memorable package: the hand-drawn sprites that make up the graphics are uniformly gorgeous in their sketchy, sparse style; the writing is an effective mix of understated creepiness and dry humour with little injections of the purely bizarre played for great effect; and the voice-acting of the characters is fantastic. There are more puzzles than in the first game, and they are more challenging, which is for the best. While I recommend it to everybody, it's not quite perfect: it is still very short, the joining of the gameplay to the story is still a little forced, and the puzzles, which after all are supposed to be the point of the game, are probably the weakest part of the package. While I appreciate how entertaining the wild swings in the story line are, it is by now obvious that there's no deeper narrative at work here, just a series of cute one-offs as they strike the writers' fancy. Nonetheless, Telltale obviously know what the strengths of Puzzle Agent are - the visuals and the writing - and makes use of them very effectively.After Special Agent Nelson Tethers did what was asked from him in the first game, re-opening the eraser factory in Scoggins, Minnesota, the case was officially closed. Tethers finds this an unpalatable state of affairs, given the enormous amount of loose ends remaining, and returns to Scoggins on his own initiative to find out what really happened to the factory's foreman, Isaac Davner. Last Tethers saw him, Davner was being dragged off by the Hidden People, the red forest gnomes that haunt the snow-laden woods of Scoggins, its folklore, and the paranoid fantasies of its residents. In the first game, the atmosphere was moody and understated, making its impact by very carefully doling out only hints and suggestions, with the occasional moment of quirky comic relief. In this game, however, Telltale have chosen to let loose with the crazy, keeping you off-guard with a series of bizarre events and visuals. In the first game, every time you see one of the gnomes it's genuinely unnerving, as each sighting carries great significance and they are few and far between. In comparison, if you see the gnomes rarely this time it's because they are sharing the stage with a large array of crazy. For intstance, within 10 minurs or so of the start, Tethers is woken up by an astronaut walking into his hotel room at night with a mysterious green light streaming behind him, and a word puzzle flying out of his helmet. The effect is less Twin Peaks, more Treehouse of Horror. This might be prudent - after all, there's only so long you can draw out a mystery - but by the end of this instalment there still is a large amount of loose ends, and the game pointedly doesn't care. The story isn't the focus, obviously, but instead the setting is. A number of familiar characters return, though none of them have such a show-stealing role as Sheriff Bahg did the first time round, the focus now being more on how Tethers himself is becoming more drawn into the lunatic puzzle gnome world. I would have liked it if there was more of a coherent story arc, and, to put it bluntly, I don't see this train getting back on any tracks in the future. But if you're going to turn your story into a series of zany adventures, you're not likely to do it any better than Puzzle Agent 2 does. The astronaut fascination goes to bizarre and amusing lengths, and the new character of Korka Tetirdottir is fantastic, especially the visuals for her and her house.The puzzles are, well, more of the same, but a little harder. There's more variation, including an interactive sequence which is halfway between a puzzle and a quick-time event (also, the only time-sensitive part of the entire game). The puzzles aren't quite as forced and disconnected from the story as in the first game, but not by much. Really, I recommend you don't pay all too much attention to them: the puzzles aren't where the action is, the presentation is. This is, as in the first instalment, is a wonderful little experience with a game attached. Everybody would do well to give it a look - it'll stick with you long after you've forgotten all about the puzzles.",

    "review_description": "Puzzle Agent 2 continues the story of Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent almost directly where that one left off. This is a good, because the first game raised more questions than it gave answers.Agent Tethers returns to Scoggins for more puzzles, sadly those are easier puzzles than in the first game. Except for maybe 2 or 3 most puzzles are solvable in a very few steps. This game is no \"Layton\", but it will require a lot of concentration.Having played game one only 2 days earlier for the first time, I can tell you, the story is about the same: No branches or alternate routes. The insanity of the first one returns, but this time it goes a little over the top. Everything strange however is at least hinted at in the first game. This feels like the story was planned out from the start and split in two games. I have a bit of a problem with this: Both games are quite short and form one coherent story, why aren't they one game? Both games would be better for it.If you liked the first one, you should check it out. At the very least to finishing the story.If you haven't played the first one, currently the steam version includes both versions, do not play the second one alone. get the first one first, the story requires it.In the end, I liked this game, mainly for it's quirky story and the nice price. The harder puzzles are truly worth it, especially the last hidden one, which took me a whiteboard and 2 hours to figure out. And I was entertained the whole way.",

    "review_description": "Puzzle Agent is a different kind of adventure game. While most adventure games have environmental puzzles that often involve combining a thing with a thing and then using it on another thing, Puzzle Agent's puzzles are far more abstract and not very related to the overall story, save for a few. Since Puzzle Agent The First is included with Puzzle Agent 2 when you buy them on Steam, I will be reviewing them both as a singular package.The Puzzle Agent games tell the story of Nelson Tethers, an FBI agent in the fictional Puzzle Division. He is sent to a  small town in Minnesota named Scoggins, where their world-famous eraser factory has been closed down due to an \"accident\". Other than erasers, this town's other hobby is puzzles, since every person you meet in town will challenge you to solve some sort of puzzle before they will give you the information you need. It seems contrived (and it is), but the game is very self-aware about it.The puzzles are inconsistent. Incredibly inconsistent, both in quality and in difficulty. Often you will use all three hints on one puzzle and submit multiple wrong answers, but then get 10 stars on the next puzzle without even having to think about it. The first Puzzle Agent's puzzles can range from the sort of difficult where you don't really know what you are doing and feel like it wasn't explained very well, to the sort of difficult where you feel smart afterwards. Puzzle Agent 2's puzzles range from patronizingly easy to moderately challenging. While there a lot of puzzles that are re-used (sometimes multiple times) in both games, overall Puzzle Agent 2 felt a whole hell of a lot easier, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. There is also the possibility that the only reason they were easier is because Puzzle Agent The First made me better at solving puzzles. I don't really know.The game's writing is very well done, but it's the voice acting that makes the characters so well-defined. It's hard to describe good voice acting, but when it's this good you can really tell. The game's story is mostly told through Nelson's conversations with the townsfolk, which usually end with them telling you that there is another character somewhere else who can give you more information. That being said, the games don't feel repetitive, but you do get the feeling at the end that you didn't do that much except ask a bunch of different people the same questions until the ending popped up and things got interesting. This is not necessarily a complaint, since when you are playing the game the story really hooks you in . I played the two games in one sitting each, which says a lot since I am not the kind of person who plays the same game for a long time.As a package, these games tell a delightfully strange story, while mixing in a decent amount of good puzzles, and the bad puzzles are saved by the fact that they usually don't take very long. Four stars!",

    "review_description": "It is time once again to step into the shoes of the FBI's best puzzle solver, Nelson Tethers. For those of you who haven't played the first game, I'm sorry but I have to divulge some secrets. This game starts up where the last one left off. You have returned from Scoggins and find that even though you solved the case of the eraser factory, you are left unsatisfied. There was so much more left unexplained, and the puzzle solver in you screams to be able to put the missing pieces that were left missing.Graphically this game is identical to the first game. It looks all hand drawn, and when they do the close ups of the characters you can easily tell that they are just scaling up the characters so that they look closer, but at the same time you can see the slight blurring and the hand drawn lines really stick out. You'll be navigating through the game once again by selecting your snowmobile and will have the map to select areas to go to. The map is sufficient and will give you all the locations that are available to you at a given time.The music in the game feels like a perfect fit. It gives you this sort of puzzle solving theme song that goes over and over again, but in a way that you don't really get sick of it. You'll also enjoy the voice acting, which I have to say definitely makes me smile. I'm a huge fan when all the dialogue is actually spoken.The controls are very simple, in the iPad version, you're going to touch the screen, and sometimes you're going to drag your finger across the screen to complete tasks.I do have to say that I felt like there was a wider range of puzzles to this second game in the series, but at the same time I did feel like there were a couple more arrange the pictures in the correct order than I would have liked. I also felt as if the number of puzzles didn't seem to be all that many. I was really starting to get into the game when the credits rolled. Now of course that's usually the sign of a good game, if you can't put it down until the end, but I had just felt as if the game was really starting to roll, and then it just felt as if the forgot it was suppose to be a short game and threw all the pieces together at the last moment. This is a fun game with a goofy story line filled with conspiracy, fantastical creatures, and puzzles. Even though its priced at below $10 I think this game probably would have been better if it was under $5.If you like the series pick up this game. If you like puzzles, and a bit of story, you might want to pick up this game. If you're looking for an immersive experience that you can get lost in for a while, then you're going to be saddened by the shortness of this game. Perhaps if you played the first and second back to back. As much as I liked this game, I can't say that I loved it, and with that I have to give this game, as good as it was, at times, a 6.8 out of 10.",

    "review_deck": "Why is Everybody's Gone To The Rapture a video game?",
    "review_description": "Why is Everybody's Gone To The Rapture a video game? I don't want that to sound rude or facile but it’s the question that I think all of us ask ourselves when playing a game like this. Does it need to be a game? Exploration games (or as some obnoxiously call them Walking Simulators) are a contentious issue leading to those who support the movement to support all the games in the genre voraciously and those who hate it to tear every game in the genre down. The main argument is that of interactivity. Does the fact that the key, and sometimes only, mechanic is simply exploring an environment and piecing together a story mean that it’s just not a game. obviously that argument is foolish. If your vision of video games purely orbits around having fun or beating something then that’s the world you live in and none of this nonsense should bother you. Like all art, frankly, it’s bullshit unless you care. I mean if you are looking for a good time don't read Moby Dick. If you gain pleasure from what you see as cultural or artistically important things then push yourself through that 50-lines-per-sentence laden novel and dude, it’s pretty great.Rapture isn’t Moby Dick. In fact I struggle to think of any game that artistically matches up to much more than a really, really good John Ford film. It’s the goddamn youngest art form and about 76% of the people playing games don’t even think it is an art form. We are all on giant bomb, in the forums…we all know this is the most important art form. I am hopefully preaching to the choir, but us and high art, it’s gonna be some time. That’s my doctrine anyway.Walking around the world of Rapture is a joy. I’m English and you so rarely get to explore such an accurate and well rendered village. Even stupid things like the picnic benches outside of the pub excited me a little. The collection times on the postboxes, the doctors waiting room, it just feels like home. It’s undeniable that the game is beautiful. It goes beyond the environment though, the lighting is atmospheric and shifts throughout play to underline the moods it attempts to create. The music is overbearing but so well produced and oftentimes humbling that it rarely ruined the tone of the game and dramatically increases it’s production values making this game feel well worth he price of admission.You are dropped into the game pretty cold. You never find out what it is that you are so to me the game is implying you are simply looking through this world and witnessing the narrative. You are nothing, you do not exist, you are the embodiment of a story line and you control it at will, presenting that information as you find it. Loosely following balls of light that may or may not be separate entities who were once human, you stumble across strange projections of people who seem to be acting out their final months of life before the rapture. These conversations are made up of around 10 characters with a definite 6 key players. It’s told out of order with the first projection clearly depicting the final days of the villagers. You’ll also hear ringing phones and tv’s with static, interacting with these will start audio recordings. Some are phones calls between two characters and others just classic audio logs, they are never jarring though them seem appropriate. That’s the game. Walk around, find a conversation, see some foreboding bloody tissues and keep going.I got lost a lot and felt a constant overwhelming feeling of missing out. I often doubted myself and would turn back to make sure I hadn’t missed a plot point along the way. Honestly, this was only because I was enjoying the stories so much I didn’t want to miss any of it. My question though; Is this a good thing? I think Rapture should be a video game. Exploring the world in your own time and way is exciting and builds a lot of tension but this feeling of missing out overpowered a lot of my immersion. I feel a button to bring up some kind of light trail leading you to the nearest story point would not damage the game and instead decrease any moments of loss. Do the developers want me to feel like there is more in their world even if there isn’t? What purpose does that serve? If you do get stuck you’ll notice all of a sudden that you move so slowly that you can’t do a quick sweep of the area to find the next thing. It can irritate. I got stuck at the lakeside camp and was wandering around for a long time before I noticed I had missed a light ball that was hanging out so close to the main light ball, I just assumed it was part of that and not a story point.Overall Everybody’s Gone To The Rapture is a good exploration game. All aspects of it are pristinely produced and if you can calm the collect everything side of your brain it’s a pleasant 5 hours. Hearing all of the villagers plots play out is really engaging and very satisfying. The main storyline however is lacking, don’t expect any satisfying conclusions. What you think is going on within the first 5 minutes is almost exactly what is going on. I feel Sci-Fi in situations like this is kind of always a bit disappointing. You won’t get a good answer because whatever response you get just aren’t reality. Infer what you like though, that’s the fun of art.",

    "review_description": "Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is a game about exploring. You are in an abandoned village with no sign of anyone and a weird feeling in the air. You want to know what’s going on and you only way of finding out is by walking around and looking at things as well as listening to past conversations.The setting of the game is a small village in the UK and it absolutely stunning. As someone who grew up in a village in the UK myself the game hit very close to home and felt eerily familiar whilst still new. As I explored I kept expecting to see something I’d seen in real life and maybe even see my own house but that wasn’t the case. The setting is by far my favorite part of the game and papers over many problems I have.As soon as you start the game a ball of light slowly approaches you and begins to move around the village of it’s own accord. It’s this ball of light that really serves as your guide in the game as it travels to certain area where you can listen to past conversations from villagers who are suspicious by their current absence. It’s in these conversations that you learn about the people of the village and what was going on in their lives before whatever happened to them.The tagline for the game is ‘This story begins at the end of the world’ which sets up the mystery and along with the previously mentioned conversations really had me wondering what happened in this village. I won’t be spoiling anything remotely towards the end but I felt very disappointed with that I was given and really didn’t feel any closure on the story at all. There’s just zero progression from when you first start to when it ends. No ups and downs or emotional moments. Just a cool premise and pretty world to explore.The walking speed is something that has already been a big talking point and it really is something that stands out when you play the game. Even calling it walking is a stretch and it feels more like a slow crawl and considering the huge areas that you are expected to search, it really is a big issue. The first area you encounter is filled with a lot of houses and didn’t feel too slow but later on when you encounter massive fields to travel through I got so bored waiting to get to the other side. You can hold R2 to walk faster but it’s a minimal speed change and doesn’t make up for something that did ultimately halt my enjoyment of the game.The game is absolutely stunning which really helps giving that the game wants you to look and explore everything. If it wasn’t so beautiful I would have been put off instantly but the way the world looked is really what kept me going when the story wasn’t progressing the way I had hoped. The soundtrack also is fantastic and really creates a sombre atmosphere that goes with the tone of the game perfectly.With such a fantastic looking and sounding world it makes it become all the more disappointing with the lack of interaction there is for the player. Listening to conversations becomes boring after a while and I really started to feel like a creeper, listening to people’s secrets. In the end the beautiful world became a rather boring one and I was left feeling like maybe everyone got invited to a party that I never got the invite for.With the $20 price tag, short length (4-5 hours) and lack of replayability; I find it very hard to recommend this game to people. If it’s featured on PlayStation Plus in the future I think it’s worth checking out as I know this game will have it’s fans but in the end I just felt too frustrated with many things. The walking speed, lack of story progression and interactivity really took away from the fantastic setting and beautiful soundtrack.I left unfulfilled and disappointed when the game ended and shudder to think about restarting the whole thing again. When done right these so called walking simulators can be a very incredible and moving experience, something that is unique to most of the medium. But unfortunately this one tries way too hard to be pretty when it really should be more concerned with having something going on upstairs.",

    "review_description": " Journey. Gone Home. Dear Esther. If you're a fan of any of these three games, the Chinese Room's newest entry into the narrative heavy walking simulator is the game for you, and only you. Dear Esther was the developer's previous title, a two hour experience that more closely resembled visual poetry than a game. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture combines the visual and aural cues of the developer’s previous tale with a far more ambitious open world setting. Ambitious...and risky.Understandably, the creators of this narratively dense affair encourage the player to experience the world they’ve created. Fullbright’s Gone Home was an expert example of setting, simply because the protagonist need only explore a two story house. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture attempts to recapture that intrigue within the confines of an entire village, and unfortunately, the results aren’t always as rewarding.Rapture’s fatal hindrance is in movement. And that was before it was revealed on launch day to have an actual sprint button. Regardless, getting around the desolate town of Shopshire is an incredible slog. An outright bummer in a game that contains such a neat idea. The gameplay consists of literally following around an orb of glowing orange light. Slowly. Traverse off the beaten path, i.e. anything that isn’t a road the orb is flying over, and you may spend ten minutes trying to relocate it.You see, the orange ball serves as the games waypoint, its critical path. In this regard, Rapture most reminds me, surprisingly, of Irrational’s Bioshock Infinite. Veering off and exploring is constantly recommended in that tale, and your rewards came in voxophones that had the potential to unleash plot revelations deeper than the actual in-game cutscenes. Rapture has these components too, mostly by way of payphones (this is the 1980s) and archaic radios. And while the glowing orange ball of immaculate light is a pretty effect, I would’ve preferred Infinite’s arrow marker as a device to use in the event of getting too lost.The lonely trek through Shopshire is only reinforced by the severe lack of visible characters. Your sole objective is to piece together the tragedy of this city, but once again, the light serves as the conduit by which you observe past characters. Turning the game’s subtitles on is nearly as much of a recommendation as having a proper run button, because you will have no idea who is talking otherwise. Watching two faceless silhouettes of light go back and forth about a topic is confusing enough with the subtitles on. Without spoiling anything, there’s a priest, a couple scientists, an old lady, an old man, and a couple younger women which comprise the entire cast. I think?In addition to the visual confusion, the nonlinear timeline of events is so hazy that I gave up on all but two of the characters about halfway through. The player has no idea at which point an event occurred; we usually only know that someone is angry at someone else, and then the scene ends. And speaking of the “player,” it is never explained just who exactly you’re supposed to be controlling. Is it a human character investigating the aftermath of this incident? Or is it simply a curiously ethereal entity which can only move about as fast an old lady doused in molasses?I was genuinely excited for an open world take on Gone Home, without really thinking about how a game like that would actually end up functioning. And regardless of the movement, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture fails to deliver consistently engaging moments; only so much of what makes a game interesting can be sacrificed before it devolves into a mindless chore of following an orange ball to the next objective. And then standing. And listening. And waiting for something, anything, to happen. ",

    "review_description": " I bought Out There Somewhere on a whim. It had good reviews on Steam, cost less than a dollar (was on sale for 49 cents) and was reported to be a short game. I didn’t have much to lose. Either I lose a few hours of my time or have a brief but enjoyable experience, fortunately it was the latter.Out There Somewhere is advertised as “inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid and Portal”. Great! I love all three of those games and I would consider Super Metroid to be my top games of all time. The bad news is that the game doesn’t really fit two of the games. It doesn’t have the multiple guns, boss battles and exploration elements in Cave Story and Super Metroid. The only game that is an apt description is Portal. Buyer be warned!The primary mechanic of the game is the teleport gun similar to the portal gun in Portal. The only difference is that instead of summoning two portals, the teleport gun instantly teleports our hero when the projectile makes contact with a wall. The teleport gun makes way for some very interesting puzzles. One common scenario is where you would need to shoot at a wall and quickly jump to maintain momentum after you teleport.Aside from the teleport gun, there is a blaster gun that you can use. Not much to say about it other than it takes a few shots to kill anything and doesn’t feel like it has a lot of impact to it.There’s nothing to the story. In fact, I can sum it up in one sentence. Generic space hero gets his ship shot down, lands on a planet, explores the planet to find parts to repair his ship and once his ship is repaired he kills the bad guy.I finished Out There Somewhere in an hour. I could have spent more time exploring and searching for hidden secrets but the game never compelled me to. After finding the parts necessary to get the ship up and running, I wanted to explore the world more. Oddly when I walked to the next screen I was abruptly placed back into the ship and fighting a boss.Overall I had fun with Out There Somewhere. The game is appropriately paced and the puzzles had a nice even ramp in difficulty. The lack of content is concerning, but given the price there isn’t much to complain about. Out There Somewhere shines well especially when compared to other games of the same price.",

    "review_description": " Miniboss games is probably not a studio many have heard of. A two-person team based out of Brazil, their biggest claim to fame was helping with art assets for the platform-based brawler, TowerFall Ascension. There’s so much more to Miniboss though, underneath that pixel art aesthetic is small devoted team that pushes a lot of unique ideas explored both inside and outside the world of 24-hour game jam events. Out There Somewhere reflects that mindset, in being a game that’s very short on playtime, but polished all the way throughout.Out There Somewhere’s story is straight and to the point. Playing as space police officer Yuri, you’re seeking to capture the crime lord Grigori after he downs your ship in a shoot-out. Armed with only a gun that shoots teleportation bullets, Yuri has to make his way across an alien planet to find parts to repair his ship, and also bring Grigori to justice. There’s no radically branching plot, no deep and ridiculous character backstory, and no plethora of story options, and it works perfectly.“Simplicity is perfection,” accurately describes how a lot of Out There Somewhere’s design choices work. You really only have the options to jump and shoot Yuri’s teleportation gun, with much of the game’s complexity coming from interactions. The teleportation gun can fire multiple shots at a time, but whenever a bullet lands against a wall it will instantly port Yuri to that location. There are plenty of other intractable objects that can effect bullets works, things like glass which can’t be walked through but can be shot through and beams of light that can change the direction of bullets.The amount of time a playthrough in Out There Somewhere directly correlates to how quickly you adapt to its puzzles. An initial run of the game could take 30 minutes to an hour, with subsequent playthroughs taking 10-15 minutes. It sounds short, but the game is only around $1.50, and when combined with the quality of everything else it feels just about right.Everything visually and auditory in the game is a throwback to older games from the early 90s and anime from even earlier. The few cutscenes in the game have that same sort of early-super robot/mecha show feel similar to Galak-Z. The pixel-work is charming in its own right, many of the planet’s non-hostile inhabitants happily bob up-and-down while waiting to be talked to. Yuri moves at a very consistent 60 fps framerate, which is needed for a sometimes physics-based puzzler. Everything from jumping to running looks smooth as butter, and really highlights how polished the game actually is. The soundtrack is great. It’s so great that the developers even have a link to it on their website. Much like the graphics, the chiptune styled OST harkens back to games of old, but also does its own thing. There’s a lot going on here that most 16-bit audio cards wouldn’t be able to produce. It sounds more like properly processed digital sound than a collection of beeps and boops.Among the myriad of sales on digital retailers and the cheap trite that often pops up on Steam, it’s easy to lose or misconstrue games that legitimately bring positive experiences at an under-budget price. Out There Somewhere, a game I had not personally known had been released over 4 years ago, but one that ended up being some of the most fun I’ve had for under $2 (honestly, maybe even $10 or $15) in a long time.",

    "review_description": "Crayon Physics Deluxe is in the libraries of scores of fiscally irresponsible gamers, having been included in a Humble Indie Bundle before the Humble Bundle service had bloomed into a full fledged shop. It was specifically included in HIB 3, which included the tremendous VVVVVV. It also included the decidedly less tremendous And Yet It Moves, a port of a WiIWare game perhaps best left in hits home mode, and Hammerfight, a shambling mound of east European physics based, mouse driven combat that only Dave Snyder could love. If not for my outright disdain for the latter, CPD would be my pick for HIB 3's real turd.The game itself is a mouse driven puzzle game divided into a series of thematically linked challenges on a map. Each core problem is the same: navigate a small red ball to the immediate proximity of a golden star. This is done by using the cursor (or, in ports to mobile, your darn finger) to draw objects within each single screen level. The game starts with fairly rudimentary challenges, such as drawing a simple line to bridge a chasm for the ball. Eventually you are shown tools like pins (to attach new shapes to existing geometry) and ropes which become instrumental in solving some of the more clever puzzles near the game's conclusion.I have two problems with the game, and they're massive. The first comes down to the underlying system of physics that governs how objects interact in levels. This breaks in so many different ways. When levels scale in complexity, the solutions to puzzles (which are mercifully freeform, though there are optimum paths to completion which may or may not be apparent) tend to become increasingly complex. This can lead to moments where the game becomes shockingly un-fun. For instance, a winning strategy near the end game tends to involve a sort of gravity winch: a rope tied to a container that carries the ball on one end, and a weight supported by a platform or pin on the other, with a fulcrum piece of geometry in the middle. Release the support for the weight, and the ball container is pulled by the rope to the star. In theory. The rope could also never really be pulled, or your weight may stick to a piece of geometry, or the ball container could be pulled over the target star by the force of the pull. You're then left to repeat the level, often iterating on the same solution until you've got things just right. I find this tedious as hell.Other levels suffer from this sort of \"bashing against the problem\" gameplay. Some require you, for instance, to interact with large physics driven objects within the level. The worst of the lot are basically large, crude drawings of villainous people which must be painstakingly moved out of the way of the ball. I was finally able to accomplish one late game iteration of this problem by employing three separate winches, two levers, and a handful of straight up heavy object drops to dislodge the ball from the creature's belly. This also took about fifteen minutes, about half of which was just waiting for momentum to shift. It was awful. Even worse offenders are levels which require use of rockets, launched by striking them with some force, to propel the ball to stars throughout the level. One of these I never will complete; two stars were nestled behind a sun and a moon, with two rockets on ground. I probably spent half an hour attempting to fire a rocket in a meaningful path to either star, to no avail.Ultimately, the physics-driven nature of the game and the tools provided to solve each problem lead to a fairly reductive solution that can work in most levels: use pins and rope to steadily scoop up and under the ball, lifting it to higher and higher levels of rope, until you reach whatever desired platform you wish. Akin to something like Scribblenauts, finding the most surefire solution can simultaneously be the most reliable and least interesting path to victory.That dovetails nicely into my second complaint, which is the level progression. Completing each level unlocks one star. There are three optional challenges to each level, however, and completing these challenges unlocks a second star per level. The game teases you to engage with this mechanic by gating a level at 120 stars on the map.Encouraging clever and skilled play is a fine thing. That said, I personally found this system lacking. The challenges per level are: completion by using one object, completion by not clicking the ball (which gently propels it forward or backward) or pins, and holy shit the last one is on the honor system. This all strikes me as either wildly difficult or laughably easy, and yet to not engage with these extra objectives is to ensure you will never see the full content of the game.Ultimately, though, that's fine by me. During my hedonistic Humble Bundle period I wound up purchasing nearly 80 games through the service. I've been trying to winnow through them ever since, trying to complete each one in some vainglorious attempt to justify the money spent. I have forever had my fill of Crayon Physics Deluxe, and don't give one good goddamn what's behind the 120 star gate. Were it not for some of the puzzles being enjoyable and the relaxing (if not particularly stimulating) soundtrack, this would be kind of a disaster. As it is, it's a brief puzzler with decidedly mixed implementations of the features that define it.",

    "review_deck": "Swords & Soldiers is brilliant simple RTS fun. My Darkzero Review",
    "review_description": "Nintendo’s Wiiware service is a bit of a mix bag at the moment, it doesn’t always bring great hits, but from time to time the occasional fantastic game pops up that is worth getting attention. The latest title to shout about is Ronimo Games’ Swords & Soldiers. A real time strategy game that is out right now to buy on Wiiware for 1000 Nintendo points. Real time strategy games don’t always get the best of praises on a console. The genre is usually held back by the limitation of the controller. Swords & Soldiers breaks this mould because the game is actually a side scrolling 2D real time strategy game, which is something you don’t see very often. I can only think of Vanillaware’s Grim Grimoire, which was a real time strategy game for the Playstation 2 that also featured 2D gameplay, but played differently to Swords & Soldiers. The 2D nature of Swords & Soldiers means that you won’t be getting a real time strategy game that is too complex. It’s simple to get to grips with, so it won’t be competing with the likes of Starcraft or Dawn of War. Even if it isn’t as deep as those games, Swords & Soldiers is still plenty of fun for gamers and a great way to pull in people who wouldn’t normally play RTS games, so in sense; the game isn’t really trying to pull in the hardcore RTS gamer.That doesn’t mean Swords & Soldiers has lost what makes a RTS good, the roots of all RTS gameplay are still here. This means you have to gather resources, for example the Vikings have huge Viking women with blonde stereotypical pigtails that walk into gold mines placed around the level to gather your cash. The levels look like they would be suited to a platforming game such as Mario, so everything is either to the left or right, rather than having a square field to play around with. Gold is the only resource management you have to gather. It’s needed for you to build more units or purchase upgrades or magical powers. Unlike traditional RTS games, the units you build in Swords & Soldiers aren’t controllable. Once built a unit will simply come out of your headquarters and walk in the direction of the enemy base, at its own pace. What this means for gameplay, is that  Swords & Soldiers loses out certain gameplay mechanics you would expect to find in a 3D RTS game. Things like unit management or the strategic planning of attack on the enemy, or grouping certain units to defend your army. Instead all this is gone, and in place, the player has to take into account the walking pace of the unit that they are building. It sounds funny, but in fact this is quite a big part of the gameplay. For example if you build a unit that is made for attacking opponents that are far away, like the axe thrower for the Viking team, then you’re screwed if the opposition send in a melee attacker that your unit can’t defend against. So you need some melee guards to protect the axe thrower, but these dudes might walk faster, depending what type of melee class you’ve selected. So you’ll have to build the axe thrower unit first, then let them walk ahead, then create the melee unit, who walks faster, to catch up to axe thrower unit at the right point in the level where you meet up with enemy resistance. It’s a genius way to overcome a problem that could have made Swords & Soldiers less of a strategic game if it hadn’t thrown in the unit speed assets. Apart from buying and deploying units, the player also has a mana stash that charges up independently. There is no way to gather more mana, only increase the speed it regenerates, through the games research system. Mana is a vital part in helping you win the fight, as in the game’s later stages you will sometimes come across stalemate battles where neither team seems to be pushing their units across the map, because they are stuck in battle with each other and constantly resupplying and dying. To help move your units across you can use mana to cast spells on units. They are defensive and offensive spells at your disposal. Each of the three teams that are feature in the game has unique units and spells. The Aztecs use poison and resurrect dead people while the Vikings use ice and electricity spells.  The Chinese on the other hand can summon a dragon or cast a rain of arrows down on the unlucky person who happens to be standing in the way. All of the three teams feel vastly different in how they play. The Vikings are a bunch of hooligans who like to go all out with strength while the Aztecs feel more like a team of trickery with their poison attacks, necromancers and human traps. There isn’t that many different units per team, but what is available feels just right for the scale of the game. The maps are very small and a mission can take between 3-20 minutes to finish. The main bulk of the game is the campaign mode, where all three of the teams have their own campaign to play through. The Aztecs and Chinese are locked at the start as you have to beat the Vikings’ story to move onto the next team. It won’t take you long to beat the campaign mode as each team has 10 missions to complete, meaning 30 in total. All of these missions can be beaten in around 5-6 hours, which isn’t that long for an RTS game, but this is a different take on the RTS genre and is only a downloadable title going for far cheaper than a retail product. Once finishing the campaign they are other areas for you to challenge yourself. Three mini games open up as you play through the campaign, which will hold your interest for a while, as you roll giant boulders, keep a Viking alive to make him walk as far as possible before he gets killed and lastly a survival mode which does exactly as the name suggests.Not to forget the multiplayer as well, as this will no doubt be your most played feature after finishing the game.  Swords & Soldiers supports up to two players offline and is done by splitting the screen so both players can see their side of the battlefield. Playing against someone good can result in a frantic fun experience. Swords & Soldiers has a gleaming graphical style that looks great on the Wii. It’s exceedingly colourful and fused with personality. It looks like an animated comic infused with the flash based games style that you often find on the Internet. The only downside I have with the game is due to the backgrounds, they are a bit static. It would have been nice to have some interactivity or varied motions in the backgrounds rather than just movement of floating clouds. Still the game is oozing with its style and humourous presentation, which is evident by the game’s story involving wacky things like the Viking team finding the perfect BBQ sauce. The whole game has a comical feeling, making it a less serious experience than you’d expect. Once again the Wiiware platform has given birth to a game that you most likely won’t experience anywhere else. Ronimo Games has created a light hearted take on the RTS genre. Swords & Soldiers has enabled a gateway for people who don’t normally venture into the real time strategy genre, to be able to pick up their Wii remote and play. Sure it has lost some of the challenge that comes with PC RTS games, but that isn’t much of a big deal when the game is crammed with charm and is a blast to play. If you want to play a RTS that’s stress free and doesn’t require much of your time, then Swords & Soldiers is perfect for you. It’s one of the better titles on the service at the moment and at 1000 points, you really don’t have to worry about the recession to buy it. Instead just get out there and find your perfect barbeque sauce, it’s a highly amusing experience.",

    "review_description": "Wiiware has really taken off this year and has seen some remarkable independent games - such as the Bit Trip series and Art Style: Orbient. However, the real star was this unusual 2D side-on real-time strategy game. It could well be the best real-time strategy game conceived on a console. Its design overcomes the limitations of using a control pad, whilst retaining all the necessary features for a fun and challenging strategic game. What makes Swords and Soldiers really stand-out is the charm and humour of the characters, which are clearly inspired by Hagar-the-Horrible.    ",

    "review_description": "Swords and Soldiers is described as a RTS game, although it does have not a lot in common with the RTS games most gamers will think about when prompted to name a few. The basic principle of the game lies in what most RTS gamers would call rushing or swarming: Quickly establish a gold engine (that's about all there is in terms of economy) and then build units like crazy to remove your enemies units from the face of the earth.The interesting thing about this game is its perspective. It is a 2D game and the game keeps things simple, because all the units you build will just wander off towards the enemy and fight whoever or whatever crosses their path. This is where the strategy comes in. The units have different abilities (let alone the three factions in the game) and sometimes you will prefer ranged units, sometimes summoners and sometimes a good old tank, most of the time a mixture of all units will do. Some levels change the goal a little bit and sometimes you will have to hold out for specific periods of time or gather an X amount of gold, the basic gameplay however does not change. Last but not least, there are spells and special defence towers that grant further bonuses.The graphics are quirky and in tune with many of the recent indie release, the game does not really have a story but it does not really need one, being more or less a RTS/Puzzle Hybrid. I say puzzle because most levels have one or two tricks to it, which you will have to discover in order to win, specific units that will unhinge the enemy's defences etc. The game is a tad too quirky for my taste and borderline racist and I wonder what an interesting game could be made if someone pairs the concept of 2D-RTS with a more interesting theme.The game took me about 4 hours to complete, although I never played it for longer than 30 minutes at a time, it's just not interesting and captivating enough but a good time filler and that is exactly what I expected for the price. The games comes with three campaigns plus a handful of challenge modes and a skirmish mode. This is far from being an indie classic such as Plants vs. Zombies but a solid past time, especially for fans of very light RTS gaming.",

    "review_description": "Tyranny of man. If I were married. Tell me where this does or does not belong. That is the game of Unpacking. Not since animal crossing has something affected my life choices so immediately. I think I’ll quit gaming and write about engineering stuff for work instead.I have to keep writing. Do I have to keep gaming in order to do that? Maybe I don’t. This is the only time I write anything down. I never put pen to paper anymore. Everything needs ‘views.’ I could continue learn multiple languages so i can negotiate rations and get in good with the guards. Truthfully, I have done everything but put in the work to perfect my grammar. Got to start that soon.There’s only so many ways unpacking can happen and I think it finished off weakly..Dream Daddy had some sort of sinister twist, as Im told. It was moderately depressing enough while playing this game that I realized how much we all aspire to have the same stuff. Our desires are not uniquely ours. We all think we are all so clever with our hat backwards and our febreeze on the toilet.Now that my microsd card reader is broken. Unpacking is what I have to do with my switch. It keeps me from playing bloated games.If this is my last game ever(?) I think it’s highly appropriate.Hd rumble feels good to empty a box. I should probably do that with my real life. I just moved in July and still haven’t unpacked. The rumble on the switch in hand held mode is a treat. I’m glad i didnt go all pinky out and get a Vita again because of some of the stuff I don’t like about Nintendo.Cruel, but I’d like a homeless version of this. Obviously free to play. All jokes aside. The YouTube algorithm decided to point me toward the ‘Hawaii isn’t affordable for locals anymore,’ video. I hate algorithms.I thought of every member of my family while playing this game. Maybe the first game ever to put me in a flow state that involved the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future. Thought about mom, dad, and sis. Definitely thought about partners and lack of partners at moving in/out phases of life. Thought about how dangerous a roomba and lit candles must be. Marie Kondo inspired? I really want to see the app store clones. I’ve gotten away from playing reality type games like sim city. This is great like that was.Also the switch controllers are my favorite controllers right now. My one year old niece loves them as a tactile toy. She also loves the Wii-U controller.This game is more an assault on my lifestyle than any mask policy. After a level it’s like my mom or partner has said this is all out of sorts. A maid comes in and cleans up my room. I love it. Until I realize it’s not real. It’s really a sad representation of my sad existence. At the moment I have re-tweaked an arm injury that will drastically change my quality of life. I was able to move myself into my house. Not sure if I'll be any help on the way out. Games like this are why you should play games. I’m really no longer enamored with 3D navigation in a 3D space. It’s been done. The switch is important for games that live in the sub $20 games where innovation lies. I’ve been scouring the games of the year list and pretty much buying anything that someone calls out. I hope that in a decade when my 2021 game of the year is questioned. I hope that I might say Unpacking and not Guardians of the Galaxy. If not that ‘game of career.’ I’m out. Sentimental like ending mask mandates on July 4th or one last cigarette at 11:59pm Dec 31st. Last game is about unpacking. I pack up my games. I used to work in advertising and the biggest advertising buy is during the Superbowl (today). I peaced out of that industry. Every year it is a reminder that you will be successful. If i didn’t pursue advertising then that would have smacked me in the face for what could have been. That and whenever i hear the Des’ree song Gotta Be Des'ree - You Gotta Be ('99 Mix) [Video]First stop after writing this review will be the game of the year blogs that i skipped discussions on Unpacking while I was playing the game and trueachievements.com. I really wish Nintendo had a system level achievement system. But I’m actually okay with it not existing. Looking at achievements before I start a game seems like cheating. But on a second playthrough it’s fair game. The limitations of the game are most curious. Can I place something somewhere? The slight upgrades to one’s electronics is very cute. It’s an essential part of life. Was.I lived in the same apartment for 17 years. Maybe I’d still have my GameCube if I had packed it away then maybe i don’t unpack it and just buy a new system. Having a lot of space allows you not to throw a lot of stuff away. I’ve subsisted with minimal stuff. The protagonist keeps their stuff, for the most part.A Lot of people in the forms want a better giantbomb.com but it sounds like they want better from the staff. I really don’t think the people griping are being fair. In my mind I think that it’s a small number of lurkers that drift in and aren't on the boards on a regular basis. If you haven’t noticed, I’ve been banned and I really don’t miss it. I try to inject some missives into my reviews but I've given up on discourse. I’m quitting games anyway, I saw some guy the other day driving a ferrari. I’m one promotion away from that (don’t get me wrong i don’t need a ferrari and would never buy one). I’m clearly under performing because I spend a lot of my time entertained. Got to put in some work. Thanks for the ban. Seriously! ",

    "review_description": "Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation is the first game in the Super Robot Wars series to be brought over to the United States. SRW is a long running series of turn based strategy rpgs in Japan known for featuring several playable characters and mecha from popular Japanese anime series such as, Gundam, Shin Getter Robo, Macross, Mazinger Z and many others. SRT OG is different because it does NOT feature any characters from anime. All characters and mecha are original creations by Banpresto. That is the reason it was brought over to the US so easily. The reason none of the other SRW games haven't been brought over here is because in the US, several different companies own the rights to each anime. For example, Bandai has Gundam, ADV has Evangelion, Getter Robo and Robotech/Macross, Geneon has New Getter Robo, and Funimation has Full Metal Panic. Even though no famous anime series are in the game there are plenty of interesting characters and cool mechs to keep you satisfied.  When you start a new game you can pick one of two different routes. You play as either Kyoske or Ryusei who will be your main character on their respective routes (but you still control all other characters and you eventually meet up halfway through). Ok here is where your patience and time are needed. Before each mission you are forced to read through tons and tons and tons of dialogue that you can't skip. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if the story was interesting, if the translation was good and if the graphics were at least eye catching. To be honest, I skipped through most of the dialogue in the whole game. I really only read the dialogue that comes up while you're in a mission.  The basic story is this: Two groups have a war with each other on earth, one side wins, then aliens show up to invade the earth and you have to fight them off. That pretty much sums it up. The dialogue is poorly translated, especially in the beginning, and the use of the text boxes is extremely poor. On average they only fit half a sentence in one dialogue box then you have to press \"A\" to go to the next. There's clearly plenty of room to fit more text but for whatever reason Atlus decided not to use it. This means that before every mission you'll be pressing \"A\" almost constantly, and the worst part is if you fail your mission you have to start over from the beginning. Not the beginning of the battle but the beginning of all the dialogue and there is no way to skip it other then pressing \"A\" a million times.  The graphics in most of the game are really bad. In the conversation sequences there is a static, boring background, usually of the bridge of your ship, the hanger, barracks or an office. You see a small icon of the character who is speaking on the left of the text box. There will be one text box on the top and bottom for each character speaking. The avatars do change expressions every once in a while but there are probably only 5 or so different variations of the main avatar. When you are in a mission the screen is set up in a top down grid. Similar to Fire Emblem or Advance Wars but with much worse graphics. Think NES graphics or SNES at best. Each unit is represented by the head of their mech or a miniturized image of the unit if it's a plane or tank. At first it will be hard to tell which one of your units is yours but you'll get used to it over time. The only redeeming factor of the graphics, and really the whole reason you'd probably play the game is the kick ass battle animations that you view when a unit attacks another unit. Each unit has basic attacks but the best animations are the \"Supreme\" attacks. These are unique to each unit. Some even have combination attacks which are very long and very cool. At first they are interesting but will get repetitive each time you see them and eventually you'll just turn them off since they take so long. So you're basically stuck with horrible graphics the whole game unless you constantly watch the animations which take a long time. If you're familiar to Fire Emblem imagine that game but without any of the animations. It'd be just the top down view with your character swinging a sword and the enemy indicating it has received damage. Pretty dull and boring.  Before you start your mission you can customize your units, their weapons, learn skills, assign pilots to different units, equip parts and weapons and save your game. The game does not have any sort of tutorial mode AT ALL. You basically have to figure out everything for yourself. And there's a TON of stuff to learn. You can try using the instruction manual but it wasn't much help to me. I'll go through the different things in the menu and tell you what they do.  First is your units. You can view info about them and see their stats, customize them or equip parts to them. The view unit option lets you see who's piloting it, what weapons are equipped and all the unit's stats. Then you can customize it using money you've earned from defeating enemies. You may upgrade the units HP, Energy, Mobility and Armor. Finally you can equip different parts to the unit. These include expendable items such as repair kits, and items that increase your energy, HP, armor, mobility, hit rate and success rate on different terrain types.  Next is the weapons menu. Here you can equip and customize the weapons of your mech. Not all weapons can be swapped between units but most can. You can customize the weapons using your cash to increase their damage rate. As with customizing units, the more you customize one thing, the more expensive it gets. Each weapon's efficiency various on the different terrain types. There are Air, Ground, Water, and Space. The lowest is C and highest is S. You cannot upgrade a weapons performance here but as I said earlier there are different items you can obtain that increases your performance on the terrain types.  Next you have the pilot submenu. Here you can see your stats, train your character to earn new skills or assign a pilot to a unit. You train your pilot by using Pilot Points (PP) you earn from defeating enemies. There are several skills to earn and you only have so many slots available to use. I highly recommend you learn SP Regenerate and Support. The first regenerates your SP, which is similar to magic points if you're familiar with RPGs. Support is a skill that lets you assist an adjacent ally in offence or defence. The extra support can help you kill an enemy or save a character from certain death. During the mission you use something called \"Spirit\" which are basically your magic spells. These are the skills you learn with your PP. The most common are Focus (increases your hit/evade rate by 30% for one turn), Alert (evades an attack for one battle) and Strike (increases hit rate to 100% for 1 turn). Others will increase your damage rate, recover HP or SP, or let you get double the exp or money in the next battle.  The next menu is where you can save your game. Pretty self explanitory. The very last option is load next map. This is what you select when you are ready for battle. You'll go through a ton of dialogue and then the mission will start. Before you start you can once again customize, equip, train and do all the things you could do in the hanger or you can just select the units you want to use and start fighting. Like I said earlier the battlefield is arranged in a grid like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. Your units will start usually clumped together in one section and the enemy will be in a nother section usually pretty far away. When you select a unit you can move them, attack, or standby (end turn). Some units can fly so you can tell them to land to conserve energy. Others can transform into a flying ship or a land vehicle. And some can repair or resupply other units.  Each mission has a goal and a battle mastery. The goal is what you need to achieve to finish the mission and go to the next. The battle mastery is a much harder thing to do but if you complete it, it will increase the difficulty level of the game and allow you to get the various secret mechs, weapons and items in the game. You probably wont get a lot of battle masteries until you know what you're doing and that probably wont' be until the second time you've played through the game. By then you've spent 30+ hours and might be sick of it. Each mission usually sees the enemy get reinforcements and some tough boss enemy to defeat.  The game is very hard and the learning curve is insane. If you have to patience to wade thru the tons and tons of text, and tons and tons of menus, then there is a good game here that strategy fans will love. If you're more into RPGs I'd suggest you try it out first. You have to plan your attack constantly and can't just run in and kill off everything like you can in many RPGs. Mainly this is because there is really no time to level up your characters. There are no random battles to gain extra exp and money (it's too bad cause you NEED it in this game). There is a game over trick you can do though. When you get a game over the game restarts at the beginning of the mission and you keep all your money, exp and such. That's really the only way to level up your characters but it takes forever since you have to wade through all the dialogue each time and there's no way to outright skip it. There is a second SRTOG game that was released recently and that one has much better animations and cooler characters but the downside is that it's much harder then the first one. If you have trouble with this game, stay away from the second cause you'll get your ass handed to you.",

    "review_description": "While Persona 5 Royal is technically a port of the original Persona 5 with enhancements, made only for the PlayStation 4, it's also so much more than that. What's offered in this package is more depth to the already incredible story, with new characters, confidants, palaces, music, and even a new semester. Persona 5 Royal is a game with heart, ambition, style, and a killer soundtrack, all of which adds to the immersion, emotional payoffs, and engrossing character arcs the game offers. At its core, Persona 5 Royal, is an awe-inspiring adventure with a bunch of rebellious kids fighting to change the hearts of corrupt adults who take advantage of, and abuse, kids for their benefit or pleasure. It's through this main plot where you meet your team, the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, and can go through the emotionally rich story the game offers. Many times throughout my playthrough I was left on the edge of my seat, with my jaw on the floor, while other times I was left speechless with tears in my eyes. The unwavering, unapologetic themes of this game can and will hit you like a ton of bricks. This is welcomed, though, because this game has a message and a heart. The injustices in which some of these characters go through is traumatizing, and does a great job at fleshing out not only the character but the world and does a spectacular job at setting up the motivation and drive your team has to move forward and put an end to it.What's done so expertly is the execution of being a Japanese high-school student by day and a complete badass vigilante with a Persona by night. The day-to-day, social, and life simulation is a great way to find out what drives your allies, and the surrounding others, forward and a great way to flesh out your character and find out all the cool things there is to do throughout Tokyo... And then there's the metaverse, where you can unleash your Persona onto foes as you push forward to fight the forces of evil with style and grace. Both are blended so effortlessly and make you appreciate the outside world as you make a direct impact on it from within the metaverse. Both are fun to poke around in and encourage you to do so. You often get rewarded for going off the beaten path, leading to helpful items, skill points, or even powerful Personas. All of this encapsulates the fun gameplay loop that has only been expanded upon in P5R. Going about your day, trying not to draw any unwarranted attention to you, and deepening your bond with your friends is a great tone-setter that is beautifully contrasted with going to the metaverse and blowing off steam after school to put your foot down against the corrupted adults who lost their way.The more important chunk of new content falls heavily on the two new characters added to the game. One of which is Kasumi Yoshizawa, a competitive gymnast that has a rather dark and complex past that's driving her to become the best-of-the-best. Although you get glimpses of her here and there at the start of the game, you don't get to build a strong bond with her until the second half of the game. But, whenever that moment arrives, it's executed flawlessly and makes you appreciate her motivations and character. The other important new addition to the long roster of great characters in P5R is the guidance counselor, Takuto Maruki. The way he's implemented is pure genius, as he fits so perfectly into the themes of the game and doesn't feel out of place in the slightest. He offers support for the student's mental health after certain events transpire at the school and is a genuinely awesome character. He's also a very important part of accessing the new content P5R has to offer and is worth following through his arc to the end. Also, the game adds in more opportunities to hang out with Goro Akechi, which allows you to get a better grasp of his goals and desires. Which helps tremendously and makes you get a better understanding of the overall themes and story of the game.The metaverse is where everything comes together. It's a place built of the distorted desires of those who have abused, and oppressed, your friends. It's up to you, The Phantom Thieves of Hearts, to sneak into the oppressor's metaverse (AKA Palaces) and steal their corrupted desire (AKA Heart). Most of the Palaces in P5R come along with a new member to join the team, and their reasoning and drive. While others are important to move the story along and offer a greater insight into the overarching world and characters involved. It might be easy to write these stories off as being over-the-top or dramatic, but it's not done just for the sake of it. These characters have a heart and a drive to overcome the years of torture and abuse that led them here. It's endearing and heartwarming when these characters make a breakthrough and had me smiling from ear-to-ear whenever they realized their true potential and meaning in the world.Besides the incredible Palaces and character development that comes along with it is the absurdly fun and stylish turn-based combat system that the game offers. Like most turn-based combat systems, the game offers an elemental system in which some enemies are immune to, weak to, or neutral to. Some foes may even be immune to all of them and only weak to physical damage or bullets. All of this, however, is made fun and rewarding with how many enemies, elements, and Personas there are in this game. There are some phenomenal battles in this game, ranging from random encounters while exploring Palaces, to the incredible boss fights you encounter throughout the game. Once you learn an enemy's weakness, you get to roll through them on subsequent encounters but as you get deeper into the game, you will meet new foes that are much more complex and challenging, which is why this combat is so engaging, fun, and rewarding. The combat is flashy, sometimes quirky, and overall a blast every time. There's never a dull moment, especially when you can perform a Showtime attack with two characters that are a visually stunning display of an ass-kicking every time one comes up.The grand finale of the game is a perfect culmination of the emotional themes and tremendous combat of the game. The final stretch of the game is off the charts in terms of execution with superb story beats, twists, music, and exceptional battles. It's here where you truly appreciate the long-winded journey that P5R offers, and everything you've been through hits you. The common theme of Persona 5 Royal is to keep looking forward and never accept defeat. This is beautifully summed up in the final act, with a lot of sad and personal moments sprinkled in. The bonds made along this grand adventure make everything much more profound when rounding out the last few moments of the game. You care so deeply about a lot of these characters and never want it to end. But, as they say, all great things have an end. And this end does not disappoint in the slightest. Persona 5 Royal isn't just a flashy turn-based JRPG. It has substance and depth, and genuinely shocking twists and turns that will have you on your feet or on the verge of tears. Beyond the engaging combat is a phenomenally written, and emotional, story with an even more phenomenal cast of character who you will love to the very end. The people you meet are not only your teammates but are your new family. Which is what makes P5R shine brighter than most and made it so much harder to put the game to an end. Even after a total playtime of around 120+ hours, I found myself excited to jump back in and experience that world, story, and characters again in New Game+. ",

    "review_description": "Four years ago, I played and reviewed Persona 5. I still have fond memories of the game. It was both an auditory and visual delight with its killer acid-jazz soundtrack and incredibly stylish presentation. I remember how engrossing the first half of the game was. There’s something euphoric about seeing a rag tag group of teenagers rebel against terrible adults. Sadly, I also recall how the second half of Persona 5 was a major let down. The latter Palaces (dungeons) were boring and long: filled with uninspired monster corridors and dull puzzles. I also remember despite the game’s length, it felt barebones. Several characters barely had any character development and the final dozen hours of the game were needless padding.I picked up Persona 5 Royal hoping that maybe things have changed. Maybe Atlus listened to fan feedback and improved the game in substantial ways. Or maybe my head was in the wrong place at that time and now I can revisit it with a fresh perspective. The good news is that Persona 5 Royal is better. The bad news is that the additions are not substantial enough to change my opinion from the original game. I wanted to fall in love with Persona 5 Royal, but the Phantom Thieves have yet again failed to steal my heart.Persona 5 Royal is an enhanced edition of Persona 5. It boasts the same graphics and core mechanics of the original game. The plot is also relatively untouched; about a group of rebellious teenagers, known as the Phantom Thieves, who gain the power to infiltrate the minds of abusive adults to change their hearts. For brevity’s sake, I will only cover the additions and changes in the Royal edition. I recommend reading my Persona 5 review (contains spoilers) if you are interested in what I thought of the game back then.There are two new characters in Royal: Kasumi Yoshizawa and Takuto Maruki. Kasumi is a renowned gymnast who recently transferred to Shujin Academy. Kasumi suffers from a mental block causing her to perform poorly in competition. In the opening minutes of the game, she makes a surprise appearance and fights alongside the protagonist, Joker. Takuto Maruki is a counselor hired by Shujin Academy. Maruki is writing a paper to study novel ways to relieve people of their stress and pain. He plays a larger role in the story once a certain vile volleyball coach admits to his crimes. Both Kasumi and Maruki are wonderful additions to Royal and the pair are the best developed characters in the game.Ace detective Goro Akechi plays a greater role in Royal. His Confidant bond no longer levels up as the plot progresses, but instead is an optional bond that Joker has to actively improve upon. Akechi hangs out in a new location, Kichijoji. Kichijoji is an area full of market stalls, a dart and billiards bar and a jazz club that can improve your party members’ various abilities.There is also a new third semester. Without giving away much spoilers, the only way to experience this new content is to max out the Confidant bonds between Kasumi, Maruki and Akechi. The third semester features the best Palace in the game layered with fantastic storytelling, elaborate level designs and clever puzzles.All of the existing Palaces from the original game have been reworked. Each Palace now contains optional collectibles known as Will Seeds. There are three Will Seeds per Palace, with a mini boss guarding the third Will Seed. Collecting all of the Will Seeds in a Palace will grant the player a unique and powerful accessory. Palaces have also been upgraded to include grappling points, in which the protagonist can latch on to, to reach hidden areas with chests and often a Will Seed room. Some of the Palaces have had their maps redesigned to include more hiding locations and new puzzles. In addition, some of the bosses have been altered with new challenging forms.The Mementos, a randomized labyrinth under Shibuya, has been slightly tuned. A new entity known as Jose (pronounced as Jo-say) randomly appears in some levels. Players can collect flowers in the Mementos and exchange them to Jose for recovery items. There are also collectible stamps which can be exchanged to improve experience, money and item rewards in the Mementos.The heart of what made Persona 5 so good was the combat and Royal cleverly improves upon it in spades. “One-More” attacks have been upgraded with the Baton Pass mechanic. Players can opt to donate their extra turn to another party member for bonus damage. Each consecutive Baton Pass increases this bonus. The third and final Baton Pass allows characters to use their skills at no extra cost. Partner attacks from Persona 4 Golden return but are now called Showtime attacks. Showtime attacks are flashy devastating moves executed by a pair of characters. Showtime attacks trigger at random times during combat. Another neat addition to the gameplay are Disaster Shadows. Disaster Shadows are enemies that explode when they are defeated, damaging all the other enemies and granting a rare item reward.Persona 5 Royal offers a host of other quality of life improvements. Guns refill ammo after each combat encounter. Personas now have innate traits such as dealing more damage after a Baton Pass or reducing the cost of fire skills. Technical Attacks can be upgraded to instantly down shadows that do not have any weaknesses. There is a shortcut menu to auto heal your party members or use Phantom Thief tools like Goho-M. The Velvet Room can go into an Alarm State which supercharges the benefits from fusing Personas. There is a menu that enables you to see and navigate to all bondable Confidants for the day. It is easier to improve Confidant Bonds with follow-up phone calls and the option to give presents. Some of the cringy writing has been altered especially the dialogue regarding two gay characters. There is also the Thieves Den, an optional area outside the main game that serves as a fancy collectible viewer.The problem I have with Persona 5 Royal is that the core game has remained untouched. Characters who I found irritating or forgettable are still irritating and forgettable. The second half of the game is still a slog with frustrating levels and boss fights. Outside of one new park clean-up event to introduce Kasumi, there are no new events or substantial changes to the existing events to highlight the chemistry between the Phantom Thieves. Even though Joker and his friends are high school students, there is nothing much to do at the high school. The Practice Building remains barren other than to visit Maruki. And the lead up to the true ending remains baffling and nonsensical.Persona 5 Royal is too easy. The game comes packaged with all the DLC from the original game. From the moment Joker has access to the Velvet Room, he can summon completely overpowered Personas for free and equip game breaking accessories. Even if you choose not to access the DLC, the game on its hardest difficulty, Merciless, is surprisingly simple. The Merciless difficulty triples the amount of damage done when targeting a weakness or using a Technical Attack. In fact, there are some fights where it is advantageous to temporarily swap to Merciless difficulty. Granted, the first 15 hours of the game are still fairly challenging on Hard mode (the difficulty level below Merciless). What really breaks any semblance of balance is the addition of Jose in the Mementos. He makes it too easy to grind for experience in the Mementos because players can top themselves up by finding Jose. Roughly a third way into the game, I was completely overleveled and had a wallet overflowing with yen.Persona 5 is a long game and Persona 5 Royal adds an extra 15 hours of content to the end. This is not the kind of RPG where the extra time spent is on completing side quests or finding rare loot. There is no way to “mainline” the game. Players have to spend dozens to hundreds of hours of their lives to see the story to its true end. The new semester from the Royal edition is truly great and worthwhile but there is still the awful awful content that takes place between September to December. As I watched the credits roll in Persona 5 Royal, I’m reminded of how I felt when I finished the original game. And to my surprise, my reaction was very similar. Other than Makoto, Akechi and Kasumi, I didn’t feel a thing for the rest of the cast and was glad the game was finally over. Persona 5 Royal is a good memorable game and will make many gamers happy, but it simply did not connect with me as strongly as Persona 4 Golden did.",

    "review_description": "（Played on Switch with Japanese voice-over and text. 93 hours to see credits roll on Easy according to save file without that “Link’s Awakening” third semester. Look, yours truly got cocky with Persona 4 Golden on Vita. Selected Normal then got chewed out by that first proper dungeon and never went back. So cut me some slack for selecting Easy with Royal.）Combing the playing of Tokyo Mirage Sessions (“TMS” for short) and Persona 5 (“P5” for short) with viewing of the Persona 3 Reload trailers is seeing that, horror of horrors, Atlus had figured out a working template for them and will repeat it. Those three titles can almost be seen as Atlus’ urban fantasy with high polygon coutn trilogy of role-playing games. P5, vanilla or Royal, is the dark middle chapter. Or at least P5 feels like the “bigger, badder” sequel to “Wii U’s very own” TMS. No, I do not mean “better” nor “worse”, the marketing horseshit “badder” will suffice here, if you allow me to explain.Released in Japan about 9 months apart to each other, TMS and P5 were developed at almost the same time over at Atlus in the mid-teens. Both take place in modern day Tokyo and share some landmarks as hub areas. Both pull the camera way back to show you what big deals their final dungeons are. While TMS is green and bright, P5 is red and dark. P5 is also much longer, nearly twice as long. Being longer, like in many other cases, is both a blessing and a curse for P5 Royal. The melodramatic highs are better than most of TMS’ light-hearted hijinks, and you all had probably heard about the convoluted lows not once but twice on this very site. This review will focus on the lows earlier rather than later. But first, allow me to lead with P5’s Japanese voice cast since the lows of this game are the story casting implies.Serious robot warriors? More like silly robot warriors.The wall of kanjis announcing Persona 5’s Japanese voice cast in the game’s Tokyo Game Show 2015 trailer. This site’s Persona 5 vanilla’s wiki page actually has fairly robust information on who played who, so check it out along with this picture, if you can. I suspect that Tactica got greenlit because someone over at Atlus took a look at the Japanese voices behind Phantom Thieves and realized that they pretty much assembled a cast worthy of Super Robot Wars (“SRW” for short). SRW is a series of turn-based tactic games sold on being crossovers among animated mech shows. Those games usually have all-star Japanese voice cast that can make Disney and Square-Enix eat their Kingdom Hearts out. Tactica is pretty much Atlus making their own SRW with cover and melee. Of course, playing Tactica alone did not make me think about SRW since the 2023 spin-off lacks the 3 following Gundam “hall of fame” members who were “only” in P5 proper.To start with a show stopper, there is the game’s human antagonist (Not the final boss mind you, since there is always a god to be killed before credits roll in Atlus offering.) voiced by Shuichi Iketa. Mr. Iketa was named on the wall of kanjis of Persona 5 TGS 2015 trailer and most famous for play the antagonistic Char in that first bunch of Gundam shows. He was likely cast mainly to deliver those enticing election speeches since Char were fund of giving those. His character in P5 being drawn like Evangelion’s Kendo Ikari with Lex Luther “hair” cut is no subtler than devil horn if you ask me.Then there is Codename: Crown, top henchman of Iketa’s character and Kai Leng looking motherfucker to a Mass Effect 3 player like yours truly, voiced by Soichiro Hoshi. Mr. Hoshi’s appearance in P5 was also announced by the game’s TGS 2015 trailer. He voiced Kira Yamato in Gundam Seed, aka the dipshit of dipshits among Gundam boys. Chef’s kiss combination pairing him with Iketa as a villain duo, who unfortunately fell into that Sith trap. Yet this bloody game and its brave band of goody two shoes want to see him redeemed while my 33 years old cynical ass would never.Finally, there is Mishima, the self-appointed Phantom Thief public relationship handler, voiced by Taisuke Sakaguchi. Mr. Sakaguchi was not mentioned by the game’s TGS 2015 trailer. He voiced the boy Uso in the rather forgotten Victory Gundam and apparently quite adored by other those over at Abnormal Mapping.Comparing Persona 5 to more recent releases like Tale of Arise and Hi-fi Rush, I can recognize the voices of the party members in the 2016 game while the rouge galley members in the 2020s outings sound more familiar. I would go as far as to say that their seething voices were what kept me going to Royal’s rather dragged-out endgame. I shall introduce in reverse order.First there are Haru Okumura Codename: Noir voiced by Haruka Tomatsu and Futaba Sakura Codename: Navi (Wonder why they changed it to “Oracle” in English. Avoiding Jimmy Camreon’s wrath?) voiced by Aoi Yuki. I put those 2 in this paragraph because they both voiced mech pilot in a baffling show titled Valvrave the Liberator. As far as my research goes (Just looking thing up on this wiki page actually.), the show is not featured in any SRW title, so Ms. Tomatsu and Ms. Yuki were not too recognizable among “mech heads”. But Atlus did cast Yuki well since Futaba is basically the same one she played in Valvrave, the man in P5 just takes care of her character there better. And woe to Haru who entered the latest. She did not just come to the scene late, she came when this revenge tale got cowardice so she did not get the pulling the stick out of her ass and s beating someone scene everyone else got.Then there are Makoto Nijima Codename: Queen voiced by Rina Sato and Yusuke Kitagawa Codename: Fox voiced by Tomokazu Sugita. Ms. Sato and Mr. Sugita were both in the short-lived Buddy Complex, and yes only the man here played mech polit while the lady played a doctor. I paired those 2 in the same paragraph since I knew them through the comic book super heroes they voiced. It’s very funny to hear Makoto and Yusuke having that one conversation about comic in the Mementos.The first 2 human party members are Ann Takamaki (Hi, honey. Sorry, but not sorry I got to say goodbye by next March.) Codename: Panther voiced by Nana Mizuki and Ryoji Sakamoto Codename: Skull voiced by Mamoru Miyano. Both Ms. Mizuki and Mr. Miyano can be seen as heavy hitter for mech-heads, the former voiced the titular female lead in Cross Ange and the latter played THE man piloting the titular war machine in Gundam Double-O. It’s worth noting that Mr. Miyano playing the impulsive Ryoji is against his performance as that Gundam boy.And there is Morgana, “Mona” for short, voiced by Ikue Otani. Ms. Otani is the voice of Pikachu in Pokemon, adding to the “Persona is Pokemon for grown-ups” myth. Her involvement in mech shows as far as I know was in Vision of Escaflowne, a Star Wars remix. She played a cat girl that can be seen as the closest thing that show has to Chewbacca…Finally, there is the player character Codename: Joker voiced by Jun Fukuyama, the voice behind Lelouch of the Rebellion himself! P5’s story is pretty much booked as Rebelling Lelouch versus Counter-attacking Char (This would look better in Japanese since no word needs changing in the shows’ titles just a “tai” put in between will suffice.). And the booking is quite well done in game with Mr. Fukuyama remains silent for most of the game but did say something closer to “We are coming for ya!” before the boss fight against the aforementioned Ikeda’s character. In fact, all the revenge plots in this game have good booking, then the autumn came and things got weird.Okay, now I finally brought up Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, I can finally talk about the convoluted lows that drove Ben Pack and Alex Navarro up the wall back in 2017. Code Geass is, to put it bluntly, a dumbass show trying to look smart by being convoluted as all get out. But it did have the decency to move on from shit because there was usually not enough screen time. Well, screen time is less of a concern in video games. So P5 basically followed that show’s habit to a t and just dragged it out.P5’s main plot is framed as the player character got arrested much later into the game and telling his interrogator about things happened since April until then. The er, dungeon masters one got to defeat were brought up by the interrogator and the player could pull a gangster style “Never heard of them” without lying. After the timeline finally caught up, there is a very long and convoluted sequence of events about how the player character broke out so the game could proceed as usual between dungeon crawling and er, dating sim. It’s about one whole hour long rather than the “half an hour” mentioned in GOTY 2017’s deliberation and it is a mess even compared to, shall we say Guns of Patriots. At least Atlus staff had the decency to allow one to save at the halfway point.I guess they just got too long a rope to hang themselves. But then this a game where a haunted house scene goes for spoopy instead spooky, plus TMS immediately before was remembered as a comedy, so how serious can one actually take P5? Well, except for all those times when someone stands up for themselves and starts to kick ass like the most effective among revenge flicks. It’s fist-bumping kind of excitement, I just wish some other parts of the game did not drag them down.Oh, I almost forgot. Royal’s new girl Kasumi Yoshizawa is voiced by Sora Amamiya. Yours truly knew Ms. Amamiya mainly as Princess Asylum in Aldnoah Zero, a mech show with so much wasted potential. Strangely Kasumi got a full “strip down before suit up” Sailor Moon the show style transformation scene when everyone else just got “one shot/panel plain clothes, the next fantasy costume” like Sailor Moon the book. This new girl is sweet and all, but the way her segment got sliced in can drag the pacing to a halt.Thug’s (dream) life after long lecturesOkay, dear readers, since you indulged me this far, I am going to get to the meat of it now. Persona series is known for its installments’ slow start and P5’s slow start is deceptively so. Player would be thrown into the mid of a dungeon raid at first, learning about its cover-based stealth, turn-based combat and that wire related swashbuckling exclusive to Royal. But that’s just getting the fun stuff out of the way first so one can sit through some bullshit more easily.The worst offender being the forced “in and out, in and out, then IN and OUT again” regarding the first Palace. By the time the game finally allowed me to raid that dungeon to my heart content, the save file said 5 hours and 43 minutes, which to my knowledge is more time than the campaign of 2011’s Modern Warfare Three takes up (Booted that campaign up ten in the evening of launch day, played in one sitting and credits rolled at three the next morning.). Holy shit, did I not have to take a 13 months long break after THAT! But the bloody game finally opened up at this point. Kill, rob and kidnap monsters, a thug’s life indeed.There are 2 types of dungeons in P5, the hand-crafted one-offs called Palace and the random Mementos. I regard the Palaces as “one-off” because they’re all about stealing the treasure in the center and defeating the boss there, no side quest would take place there. The still tongue-in-check Requests are all about search and destroy in Mementos. In fact, Mementos’ layouts are so random, once I was stupid enough to go down level-by-level then go back up level-by-level, the layouts did not stay the same.Dungeons aside, Persona games are also known for being half a dating sim, some daily schedule management that does impact the dungeon crawling. The dating sim stake of choose one to hang out over another is present, in opposed to TMS’ “just different order of doing things”. Of course, it will compel people to try the New Game Plus after some already long playthroughs. Yours truly took up a Request for Mementos manhunt just before the schedule locked into the endgame. So, that hunt was called off, unless I became deranged enough to start that NG+.“Commitment” is secondary though. For one thing, the fuck boy path is paved for those willing. For another, even if player fouls up on dialogue selection or gift giving fronts, there are ways to make up and it would just take longer to reach the top Rank 10 of any relationships. The grand farewell tour of TMS’s epilogue is present, though one can only bid farewell to those one knows best there.Of course, the dating sim element is not all about winning a girl’s heart or the homoerotic tension, it also impact the dungeon crawling on the following 2 fronts: A enhancing the Persona with each tarot card labeling and B unlocking quality of life improvement. Take that Shogi girl Alex Navarro was sweet on for example. Building relationship with her would allow player to escape battle earlier and switch party member during battles. Getting closer to those people will also unlock side quests of “character assassination”. Not the kind of dragging one’s reputation through the mud, but hunting down their worst impulse in Mementos.As a JRPG came out in 2016, it would be fair to say that P5 was trying to add some “cool” elements from western games to spice things up. There is the point & click style cover-based stealth that allow one to get across areas in dungeons if they are not in the mood for the deadly poker games. Exploring Mementos can be described as vehicle sequences. And then there are the guns in said deadly poker games. I was informed that Royal made some change, with all party members having full magazine at the start of each battle. It’s pretty much “You better run, cause we got guns” at first. But then Atlus’ elementary consideration kicked in and fire-arm is just another element to be considered. It’s not total insignificant though, as melee shocked enemies would hurt part members, shooting them from a distance is safer.You got to think that with TMS being a Fire Emblem crossover it’s already closer to chess than other Atlus titles. In TMS, enemies’ elemental strength and weakness are shown plainly during battle. In P5, one got to pull the left trigger and select Analyze to see all that. It would not be a problem until a later Palace end boss fight and its real time countdown of 30 minutes. Ah, turn-based fights with long cannot-be-skipped-only-fast-forwarded animation and real time countdown were not fun in days of that first Playstation, and it sure does not get any better in these day of the fifth. The sliver ling here is that multiple checkpoint one can roll back to. But if you think the fight is doomed for you half-way through, turn off the game and boot it back up is still the only way.P5 combat is closer to poker for all those deus ex machina like aces in the holes at player’s service. Knock enemies down during their elemental weakness or make a critical hit will greet the party member another action. Knocking all enemies down will trigger the all-out attack or a chance of other crimes. I am of course talking about “robbery” and “kidnapping”, I found the former to be a nice way making extra bucks while the latter is the Pokemonish “catch them all” aspect. It takes more conning than force with the whole “high stake” dialogue selection.Show Time attack is another ace in the player’s hole. Those usually start with party members talking to each other in the real world about some play acts they want to try in the dream world. The tongue-in-cheek or even piss-taking presentation of those made me think: why didn’t anyone sell P5 as a comedy? Why did you lot focus on its half-assed handling of serious topics? You got 1970s’ love story comic for girls but guns are hidden in the flowers. Then there is 1980s’ action comic for boys with wasteland setting, current days’ men cooking comics, Edo period erotic drawing, high-octane action cinema and pro wrestling tag team. All made me laugh and all turned tides of several fights.Dipped in styyyyyyyleStrangely, I took P5’s doubling down on style better than its doubling down on substance. This is a comic book like video game in presentation, word boxes are stylized as word or thought bubbles. Skippable cut scenes are like page ripped off and made into balls. When polygonal model and 2D portrait cannot handle people’s expressions, the focus on their eyes would liberally slash across the screen. Interface’ style does add to the mechanic enjoyment. Like how commands are placed around party member as if they just burst out. The placement does line up well to the face buttons, d-pad and triggers.But style has its downsides too. Like how dungeons are designed prioritizing visual in a way one cannot tell the interactable bit from “window dressing”. Atlus simply gave up and offered a “thief vision” on the left trigger. And I guess putting the player character on menu just became the Altus houses tyle as they even added it back to the Persona 3 remake.When I first played the game on PS4 with a disc back in 2016, the frequent pre-rendered anime cutscenes at the first hours nearly made me thought “Was OVA back with a revenge?” Well, barely. But those do signify money shots and worst impulse. By the former I mean the expensive blockbuster style destruction scene. By the latter I mean the sex comedy bits that usually take some er, details to work…Nintendo Switch: Still the way to play anywhere apparently.Before this roaring twenties, Atlus was the weirdest kind of developer for multiple platforms: cast a wide net across all yet oddly stubborn about each product’s platform exclusivity. By the time P5 Royal got out of its PS4 jail, its being on Gamepass was just met with a “It’s almost 3 years old, heh? Fair enough”. Still as someone who was drawn to Persona series since Gamespot’s Gameplay podcast (rip) talking about Vita’s Persona 4 Golden, yours truly would like the most portable way to play Royal. Enters the Switch. No offense meant for you, Steam Deck.Well, anti-aliasing is bit rough at places but it is small price to pay with portability. As handheld device getting bigger, the ones before feel more portable. Switch can be played in a rather crowded train, on the Lou and, for the comfort of those winter days, in one’s warm bed. I saw through the whole bit that drove Ben and Alex up the wall in bed. Had I seen that in front of a console while freezing my ass off, I do not think I could even have made through that bullshit.The most game yours truly ever played…“One last job” is a heist film trope P5 had done one too many times. The first time it appears just as the timeline is about to catch up with the flashforward and one just assumes “There got to be more after”. Boy, isn’t there so much more. The second time is before taking down the game’s quite-well-booked-all-things-considered human antagonist, by which time the Atlus trope alarm went off in my head and I thought “Whose divine ass do I have to kick to see credits roll, you long game?” That divine ass duly appeared about 4 hours after that. I am actually glad that I did not get to Royal’s fabled third semester if I am being honest.Once I thought TMS as merely an appetizer before the meal in P5. Now I see TMS as a more well-rounded product on its own while P5 Royal is bit out of balance with higher volume. Had I made through Royal before not-E3 (R.I.P to E3.) 2023, P5 Tactica would not have been on my radar, no matter how much that PC Gamer review praised it. The whole experience is bit disappointing as I hoped to add a stone-cold classic to favorites, but it felt more like moving one big item off the backlog. The game simply took a long time to open up then even took longer to wrap up. There are highlights of melodrama, hijinks and action that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the packaging could have been tighter. Oh well, hopeful the next time you put up a wall of kanjis for a product, you can tighten up the final product, Atlus.Speak of which…The wall of kanjis shown in Metaphor: ReFantazio’s Game Awards 2023 trailer. It’s only in the Japanese language version on Atlus Japan’s Youtube channel right after the “Fall, 2024” release window announcement. Quite the Tokyo Mirage Sessions reunion and then some. I would also call it “eat your heart out, Super Robot Wars” casting since 4 of those got top billing in interactive mech things. The one most right on the second line voiced 2B of NieR Automata fame. The one with no kanji in her name got top billing in Armored Core Six. The two in the last line at the left down corner voiced Solid and Liquid Snakes respectively. And see the one in the first line at the right up corner, he provided voice for that very first Gundam boy, you all. Guess with P5 still getting spin-off more than 7 years after its Japanese release while TMS only got a Switch port, “walls of kanjis announcing voice cast” just became a ritual Atlus performed to secure commercial success. Or it’s just how Hashino and his 2 frequent collaborators roll. Oh well, Metaphor: ReFantazio sure got my attention now.That’s all, folks. Sorry for mimicking P5 Royal’s ended more than once habit. Playing a game long and it will rub something on you, usually its worst impulses.",

    "review_description": "Bloodborne is a game that has carried a lot of expectations with it. Although its not technically a souls game, it is heavily inspired by that series, taking many of its mechanics forward to Hidetaka Miyazaki's latest creation and for all intents and purposes functions basically in the same genre that Dark souls and Demons souls occupied. But its the changes, not the holdovers, that make Bloodborne a fantastic game. After Dark souls II, I personally felt like another game in that exact same mold would start to feel slightly old. However, Bloodborne alters the formula in numerous significant ways that do a good job of having the gameplay feel familiar, yet way more exciting than previous souls games. The excellent changes that were made, coupled with a more insane, more up front story make Bloodborne an incredibly easy game to recommend.So what exactly has changed in Bloodborne? For starters, right up front you'll notice that the game operates at a quicker pace than previous games in the series. Many encounters encourage you to take a more offensive style of approach to combat, instead of the shielding focused style of play that many people adopted in the previous games. Shields are essentially nowhere to be found and instead in your offhand you will be wielding some sort of firearm, such as a pistol or a blunderbuss. On its own the guns don't do much damage but often times your pistol can serve as a type of shield by being able to perform a gun-parry. If you time your shot just as the enemy is about to attack, you will stun it, creating an opportunity for you to run up and perform a 'visceral attack', a very powerful attack that can often kill your target. This makes the inclusion of guns a very smart idea that changes the way you have to approach combat, and although its not essential, its very important to learn the timing of the parries because its a good way of killing your enemies quickly and without taking damage.In addition to the faster pace, the way health and health items function has also been changed. Instead of having estus flasks that can be refilled, you now have a finite amount of health vials at your disposal. Although it sometimes creates the frustration of having to farm enemies for materials, it also makes you want to play better, knowing that once you use a health vial, you're not getting it back. Furthermore, Bloodborne also introduces a great new mechanic in which after you are hit, you have a small window to attack an enemy to regain some of your lost health. Once again, this encourages a more aggressive style of play in which you want to attack the enemy after he hits you, instead of backing off and waiting for another opening. On top of that, the regain system is a great way to conserve health vials, now that they are in limited supply.It also creates a fantastic risk-reward dynamic where often times you move in to regain your health, but sometimes end up losing more health in the process. It's always harrowing to have to make a split second decision of how aggressive you want to be in combat. This dynamic was not really present in previous games, where it was almost always easier to just be passive and wait for your enemy to make the first move. Having more encounters with multiple enemies also increases the tension of combat, where you have to be wary of many possible attackers, rather than just one. All of these mechanics come together in a way that is incredibly exciting and has not been present in any of the previous souls games. I had an absolutely amazing time with the first section of the game, where I had to rethink all of my strategies in order to be in line with the way Bloodborne operates.Now there are some problems with Bloodborne, although none of them have much to do with how it plays. The biggest issue with Bloodborne is its lengthy load times, which can be about 40 seconds loading into the large areas and it can sometimes really kill the mood. Normally after you die it takes you a good 20 or so seconds to recover from what just happened to you, but having to wait another 10-20 seconds after that can really put a damper on your enthusiasm. Loading into the hub world, the hunter's dream, takes significantly less than that, but the fact that leveling up, warping to someplace else and buying items is locked away in that area often makes you wait around quite a bit. It can be very frustrating at times. Every once in a while the framerate of Bloodborne can be sub-optimal, mostly when there are numerous enemies on screen. However, most of the time Bloodborne is a gorgeous game than runs very nicely. There's no blighttown of this game where one entire area suffers from a bad framerate. Many of the weapons have great animations that are always a joy to execute against enemies and a ridiculous yet very fitting blood effect showers the screen in blood with each hit, eventually reaching the point where most of your character is covered in blood. Its actually fits very nicely in the game, even though its a bit much at times.The other part of Bloodborne, which I found to be somewhat surprising was that I was able to beat most of the bosses and complete it in just under 30 hours, which is a little bit shorter than what I was expecting. Now of course I didn't beat every single boss there was to beat and there may have been an area or two that I didn't fully explore, but 30 hours was a fair amount lower than I expected it to be. However, I do feel like all of the hours I spent playing the game were packed to the brim with exciting moments so it was something I was more easily able to overlook. Personally I didn't mind the lower emphasis placed on magic and PvP in Bloodborne but as a person who never really got too deep into either of those, it didn't affect me all that much.Chalice dungeons are also present in Bloodborne and in my experience, they were pretty hit-or-miss. They basically function as side-dungeons to the main game that you collect by finding them in the world or beating certain bosses. Some of them have a set layout and some of them are randomly generated, so there is the possibility to get tons of extra value out of them. One of the problems with that is that it is quite easy to outlevel a lot of the chalice dungeons. If you are not playing them right when you get them, chances are that once you do get around to playing them, they will be really easy and not worth your time. But if you do manage to find the sweet spot of difficulty, they can absolutely be very enjoyable. They do contain unique bosses so at the very least you should check out one or two of them in order to see the bosses as well as get useful items that you can take back into the main game.There's also one more thing that needs to be talked about, and its Bloodborne's story. Ordinarily when talking about a souls game, there wouldn't be a whole lot to say in this regard, other than it has a nebulous story that eventually reveals itself after a LOT of digging. While Bloodborne's story is still quite nebulous, let's just say its pretty hard to miss. Obviously I won't give anything important away but things get pretty nuts towards the end. As you play through the game, the world of Yharnam will undergo some major transformations that are pretty cool and if you are willing to explore the optional areas, you can expect to be very suprised with what you find. Many people have brought up the name H.P. Lovecraft and his work and without giving anything away, I'll just say its a pretty apt comparison. Its crazy and that's the exact reason why I love it.To wrap it all up, its very hard to envision a reason as to why you shouldn't play Bloodborne. I'd generally agree with the statement that if these games haven't hooked you before there isn't a whole lot that will draw you in with this one. And if you don't own a Playstation 4 its always really tough to recommend picking one up just for the sake of one game. However, if you've been wondering what these games are about or you've enjoyed souls games in the past and you happen to own a PS4, BUY THIS GAME! The very small amount of problems do very little to get in the way of what I feel is the strongest and well rounded entry in the souls series to date. Basically all of the changes made to this game were for the better, and in the end, Bloodborne is a game I had an absolute blast with from start to finish. What a fantastic game that gave me absolutely everything that I could've asked of it. ",

    "review_description": "When it was announced that Demon's Souls and Dark Souls' creator Hidetaka Miyazaki would not be on board for Dark Souls II, some fans of the series became skeptical of the quality and direction of that game. Though Dark Souls II was a good game, a certain life was missing from the world of Drangleic that brought down the experience. You might say some part of it felt hollow, or perhaps a bit drained of its soul. A deviation from the standard Miyazaki set, Dark Souls II is not the game it could have been. Fans left wanting of a fine action game (and with PS4 in tow) need not worry: Bloodborne is a continuation of the tradition that brought Demon's Souls and Dark Souls to life.Taking on a gothic, dark fantasy style, Bloodborne boldly establishes itself as distinct from the Souls games. This carries into its gameplay too - numerous subtle changes have been made to its core, and some elements of Souls games have been streamlined. Carry weight, for instance, is no longer an issue, and weapon attack damage is no longer dependent on which hand slot that weapon occupies. Magical abilities are sparse, and shields sparser, the option of using various firearms or a torch (with infinite duration!) at the forefront. Anybody arguing that streamlining is always a negative should look to this game: all of these changes come together to make for faster, tighter gameplay that will challenge the most seasoned of the franchise's fans. Players new to From Soft's action-RPG's of late should be warned that these games will punish foolishness and button mashing, emphasizing careful envrionment navigation and mastery of the deep combat mechanics. This game keeps the hand-holding to a minimum, allowing the player a genuine feeling of discovery when stetting foot into a new area. Within these levels are powerful items and gear that reward your thorough exploration. The game wants you to succeed, and provides all of the tools to do so in spectacular fashion. It is up to the player to make effective use of these tools to succeed, and this aspect has always been From's greatest strength. That sense of accomplishment gained from downing a boss after repeated attempts, or discovering a new door after painstakingly combing recently visited areas is as energizing as ever. Each first step into a new labyrinth of bloody perils is an exciting moment, and the game's more dynamic world states ensure an experience that will keep the player evolving. By the end of your first playthrough, you'll feel like a badass, and that's great. This feeling is also fleeting, however, when you enter the new game plus mode, adding further to the difficulty of subsequent playthroughs.Bloodborne marks a significant technical improvement over Dark Souls. The engine has been improved with the ability to draw detailed distant objects, and boasts vastly upgraded shaders from its predecessors. Immaculately detailed and swathed in particle effects, Bloodborne's environments exude a beautiful, hand crafted style that doesn't rely on intense technical fidelity. Despite this rich presentation, however, Bloodborne's greatest falling is its inability to maintain consistent performance. Long load times, stuttering, and the occasional frame rate tank can be observed, comprising an unfortunate trend in Miyazaki's games. I should note that the frame rate is usually very solid, especially in boss encounters. Compared to the travesty that was Blighttown, nothing I've experienced in Bloodborne comes close. These issues can be an annoyance from time to time, but my overall experience was very largely undiminished by them.There's just so much more to say about Bloodborne, but the truth is that it's better to experience it for yourself. I highly encourage anybody and everybody who owns a PS4 to give this game a try, as it is easily the best exclusive out on the console at the moment. Every bit challenging as its cousins in the Souls series, and boasting a high degree of polish, Bloodborne sets the bar high for Action-RPGs to follow. A must own.",

    "review_description": " “He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.” William Gibson once spoke of writing his first novel Neuromancer (which would become the progenitor of the cyberpunk genre) that by not explaining what certain slang meant or how certain machines operated, his key goal was for the reader to experience complete culture shock. In a similar fashion the Souls games provide the exact same feeling of entering a foreign world that isn’t conveniently waiting to explain itself, and yet through this strangeness it’s immediately apparent that it has existed for ages before we even got there - and it’s our job to become acquainted with it’s customs. Just like Gibson novels that feel completely baffling at first, you push on, figuring things out bit by bit, and by the end when you’ve completely become entrenched in the vernacular, looking back the journey feels all the richer for it.While the first From Software release in a while to not feature their now trademark “Souls” in the title, Bloodborne is very much a Souls game in all but name. While there are some key differences in mechanics, the overall design remains true to the series. What really differentiates Bloodborne from past games is a Treyarch/Infinity Ward divide, where two teams work on the same product and for whatever reason one team actively decides not to use the solutions of the other. Since series creator Miyazaki did not directly work on the previous entry, some consider Bloodborne a true sequel, discounting Dark Souls 2 as a mere B-team stopgap. After having spent time with the game though, it becomes apparent that the B-team had some pretty good ideas that probably should have stuck around.But what is Bloodborne about? Once again the player takes on the role of a newcomer, arriving to partake in a story that seems to have already ended before you even got there. Taking a step back from rustic castles, clunking armor and the medieval aesthetic as a whole, Bloodborne takes us to Yarnham, a fictional town reminiscent of a dark, victorian era London with the accents to boot. In short: You are a hunter and it just so happens to be the night of the hunt, when wild beasts prowl the streets and normal folk lock themselves in their homes awaiting the safety of dawn. The long version is that the onus is really put onto the player for how much you get out of the story part of the game. Series veterans know exactly what to expect when venturing forth, but newcomers might find that answers are in scarce supply and a helping hand is nowhere to be found. There are many indirect clues scattered throughout the world. Generally you are meant to piece the story together from sparse snippets of cryptic NPC dialog, studying descriptions of all the items you come across and correlating that information with enemy placement, their surroundings, their drops, everything. Everything. At first glance you might be killing a wacky enemy you just encountered along the way, but there might be a reason why that enemy is standing where they are, and why they drop the specific item they do. You have to pay real close attention to connect these loose strands back together and even then it’s all just speculation. Thats the kind of experience the Souls games offer, which isn’t for everyone of course, and Bloodborne is no different. I’ll say that if you really dive deep into the lore and use the internet to it’s fullest potential, there are some very interesting concepts at play, but it does require considerable effort to unearth.Gameplay fares much better in terms of clarity, but it’s not without it’s own set of mysteries. Generally the ebb and flow of combat has remained similar to past entries. Bloodborne is an action RPG that places heavy emphasis on player reflexes while augmenting them with stats. A big selling point of these games has always been the fact that there is never an enemy that you simply cannot face because you’re too low level. You might deal very low damage to said enemy, but if you are good enough at the game to evade all their attacks you will eventually whittle their health down to zero and prevail. Higher stats will merely expedite this process by giving you a bigger margin of error with higher health and more damage. The general idea is that stats don’t define what you can do in the game, but like any RPG being underleveled or overleveled can greatly influence how each enemy encounter is going to play out.Despite the famous reputation for being both extremely difficult and overly obtuse, the Souls games are fairly straightforward in regards to the gameplay loop. You enter a new area, and methodically work your way through it until you find the boss at the very end. The world of Bloodborne can be generally divided into greater Yarnham and the Hunters Dream, which serves as your hub where you’ll be able to level up, upgrade weapons, buy items and engage in optional side dungeons. It’s a neutral area, completely disconnected from the rest of the game world that contains no enemies and is the only place from which you can travel to other parts of the world. Lamps are strewn throughout the many different areas of Yarnham acting as both spawnpoints should you die, and a means of traveling back to the Hunters Dream. When entering a new area your first goal will usually be to locate the next lamp in sequence. Level design is probably the best we’ve seen in the series. Not only is this the most detailed world that From Software has crafted yet, but the paths within each major zone twist and turn in such unexpected ways that finding and unlocking shortcuts not only brings a sigh of relief but also a sense of awe. You might crawl up onto rooftops, descend down into sewers, only to come back out and ride an elevator that opens up right beside the lamp that you started from in the first place - it can sometimes take a moment to find your bearings and marvel at how ingeniously From Software has connected these paths through the sprawling city. Exploration is key as all major pieces of loot are statically placed throughout the world as opposed to being random drops from enemies. Ultimately your goal in each area is to defeat the boss, thereby unlocking the next place to explore and furthering the storyline..Stats are still increased by way of defeating foes and absorbing their blood, which you then cash in at home base in the ethereal Hunters Dream. Blood or “blood echoes”serve as the ultimate currency which can be used to purchase stat points, equipment, weapons or items. It’s also a currency that you always carry on your person, and if you were to perish in combat it will remain on the ground where you died in the form of a bloodstain that you’ll need to run back to collect. Die on your way there it and your hard earned blood echoes are gone forever. This system is one of the main reasons Bloodborne can be so exhilarating despite it’s rather slow and methodical approach to combat. The pressure ramps up slowly but surely as you require more and more echoes to level up, making death and the potential loss of currency a growing concern. You may find yourself deep into a peculiar area, having amassed enough echoes to level up two or three times, but you don’t know what is coming up ahead. Do you risk it all and keep going, hoping to find a lamp that will teleport you to the safety of the Hunters Dream, or do you backtrack the way you came and cash in all your echoes before venturing forth once more, now bolder and wiser from your initial excursion.Returning are player messages and death phantoms that mark the unique online feature of these games. Using a set of templates, players are able to leave messages on the floor warning others of ambushes, directing them towards hidden secrets, or tricking them into jumping down bottomless pits to their doom. Seems like a small thing, but sometimes a message could literally save your life. The death phantoms that show the last few seconds of a players life before they perished are equally helpful but in my experience with the game they rarely worked. Co-op works much like it did in previous games except it now uses the new Insight currency. At nearly any part of the game a player can ring a small bell in order to summon nearby players into their own game to help out. Similarly players that are looking to help out need only ring their own bell, and wait to get sucked into a work that is beckoning for help. There are minute differences, such as helper phantoms being sent back to their lamps if they die in the hosts world instead of appearing back where they were summoned from, but generally the mechanic is very similar. The severe lag you experience while playing co-op is very much a brand new, and very unwelcome, addition.A big addition to the series are the Chalice Dungeons which are accessible at any time from the Hunters Dream, granted you have the right materials. These are optional side dungeons that start out the same for all players, but can be randomized and played on higher difficulties when using special items. Although it’s a little jarring at first to see such mechanical level design, crafted from prefab pieces, there are plenty of unique enemies and some items that not only extend the life of the game but offer a level of challenge not found in the main game.Combat is probably the biggest change some veterans of the series will have to adjust to. In order to craft a faster and more mobile experience Bloodborne puts a heavy emphasis on aggressively engaging your foes. There are no practical shields or heavy armor in the entire game that might help to mitigate incoming damage. Instead you are meant to be constantly moving about and dodging instead of passively taking hits with a shield. In the spirit of this active combat approach your offhand can be equipped with a firearm that is used to interrupt enemy attacks and put them into a stunned state from which you can pull off a “visceral attack” that deals critical damage. Likewise healing has also been refined to allow mobility. Gone are estus flasks that would glue you to the ground while you healed, instead being replaced by blood vials that are replenishable through enemy drops and allow you to move while you pop them off. Health also uses a regain system that allows the player a short window of opportunity to get it back by dealing damage. Upon getting hit the lifebar moves back into a lighter shade, indicating a portion that can be regained if you attack an enemy quick enough. All of this makes for a quicker, lighter game, that favors hit and run techniques and punishes passivity.Apart from those changes it’s business as usual. Besting typical mobs you find along the way requires little more than memorizing their limited moveset and dodging accordingly while managing your stamina between attacks. When locked-on the regular roll turns into a quick dash that seems to have even more invincibility frames than your regular roll, and evading as a whole takes very little stamina which in turn replenishes very rapidly. All weapons have some manner of transformation that clicks into place with satisfying shower of sparks and a loud clank. Unfortunately despite their cool look, most of the weapons in Bloodborne are basically the same weapons we’ve been using for the past three games. The movesets seem fairly identical, with your standard short sword, falchion, rapier moveset. You might be hold a giant looking cleaver, but it moves the same way your falchion did three games prior. In that Bloodborne is slightly underwhelming, as there are way less weapons overall, and what there is acts just like the weapons you’ve used for hundreds of hours prior. Transformations are neat, but they’re a glorified two handed mode that is now repurposed with a cool new animation. There is some usefulness to this mechanic as it allows for limited variety, like a greatsword that can transform into a single handed straight sword, but generally apart from looking really cool it’s nothing we haven’t seen these weapons do before.Soul games have always been about choice. The player had dozens of options on how to approach both the world and character growth from the very beginning of their adventure. Strangely enough Bloodborne takes a step back from what Dark Souls 2 had built and instead is a much more focused and simultaneously limiting experience. There is no more equipment load so you’re no longer managing your weight because roll speed is always the same. All armor that can be found is within 10-20 stat points of each other making them more of an aesthetic choice rather than a meaningful build option. Weapons are generally strength or skill (dexterity) based, with the game heavily favoring the strength variety. There is some magic but it mostly comes in the form of buffs and surfaces beyond the halfway point, meaning you’d be dumping points into a build that won’t be useful for the first 15-20 hours of the game. There is also a blood stat which governs firearms and buffs certain primary weapons that are also almost all exclusively found in a high level optional area unlocked towards the second half. This leaves the player with two build choices honestly: strength or skill. There are more strength based weapons in the game, and the way they’re able to stunlock both enemies and bosses more than makes up for their lack of speed. Skill weapons overall, such as the threaded cane or the blades of mercy, have very little going for them apart from speed. The trade-off is that while you do less damage with each hit you can attack more often, but up against bosses and bigger foes this doesn’t work so well in practice as you have to dodge back to avoid attacks interrupting what would normally be your longer attack string. Ironically while the strength weapons hit slower, they will often stun your opponent allowing for more continuous hits than their skill based counterparts.By forcing the player to fight more actively From Software has effectively funneled everyone into a very specific playstyle. In any of the previous Souls games you had an option to bulk up with heavy armor and get the biggest shield you could, or put on lightweight clothes and dual wield a greatsword, or carry a small shield in your off hand and use it for riposting much like the guns are used in Bloodborne, or carry two swords and riposte with your offhand sword, or use magic which was readily available from the outset of the game, so on and so forth. The possibilities seemed endless and it catered to many different playstyles. Bloodborne can only really be played the one way. You mostly dodge and if you want to get fancy you can parry with the gun once in a while but honestly you could go the whole game ignoring the parry mechanic and be just fine. This severely limits replayability in a series that was known for just that. I finished the entire game using the same weapon I chose at the very start, wearing the same gear I found in the very first area of the game. This is disappointing when compared to the dozens of armor sets and weapons I was mix and matching throughout Dark Souls 2 even before I got the the halfway point.Bloodborne is also the most technically flawed game of the bunch. It is truly astounding that From Software is on their fourth game in the series and we are still experiencing the exact same bugs we’ve been seeing since Demon’s Souls. NPC quests while already extremely esoteric in nature will break at random, as they have been prone to do in the past. Dark Souls 2 introduced an improved lock-on system that allowed you to target boss limbs, something that Bloodborne didn’t see fit to incorporate, resulting in the worst camera and lock-on the series has ever seen. The very first boss fight against the Cleric Beast is nearly unplayable if the player chooses to lock-on, causing the camera to constantly clip outside of the boss arena blocking off your view, only to snap back in way too close because of the tight surroundings. Visceral attacks (backstabs from the front) are still extremely finicky to pull off. You’re too close, it won’t work, too much to the side, too far, higher or lower than the enemy, it just won’t work. Hit boxes can still be an issue especially in boss fights. This isn’t even mentioning the now famously long load times and inconsistent framerate. Bosses while extremely creative in their design will more often than not be an exercise in frustration as the camera simply cannot handle following creatures so much bigger than you, forcing you to fight without lock-on, which in turn restricts you from using the evasive dashes which are the one good improvement to the combat.Bloodborne also suffers from the typical Souls problem of losing direction in the latter half of the game. In an effort to introduce a narrative twist, halfway through it becomes less clear what it is you’re doing, where you should go or what your overall goal is. You fall back on basic instinct of travelling through an area and killing a boss at the end, but it all seems rather disconnected from the first 15 hours of the game. Obviously there are storyline reasons for why this part of Bloodborne plays out the way it does, but it takes a lot of sleuthing through the little lore you have access to in order to start making educated guess for what it is.All these problems aside Bloodborne is still a great game and a unique experience, especially for new players. In a market saturated with constant tool tips and waypoints, the Souls games are always a refreshing reminder of what it was like to get truly lost in a videogame. It’s simply disappointing that what should have been a brand new start for the franchise in a new generation, turned out to be merely a fresh coat of paint with all the old baggage in tow. It’s beginning to be hard to tell whether From Software simply lacks the technical talent to overcome these hurdles, or whether they simply don’t care. While obviously not for everyone, Bloodborne is one of the best games out on the PS4 right now, a must-have for returning Souls veterans and a good starting point for curious newcomers alike.",

    "review_description": "You know what? Maybe I'm not the right person to praise Bloodborne. I never enjoyed Demon's Souls, I didn't care for Dark Souls 2, and the furthest I ever got in the first Dark Souls game was the boss fight with the Capra Demon. But this wasn't the case when it came to Bloodborne. No matter how many times I failed this time around, I instead got right back up and continued pushing forward. Bloodborne isn't just a fantastic game, it might just be the game that finally got me to appreciate and understand the draw and affection many have toward the Souls series of games.Progress in Bloodborne is completely your problem and any failure is most likely your fault. Figure out the proper way to go about playing the game, and the game will reward you for taking the time and putting forth the effort. Mess up, and you'll have to keep playing the same bits again and again until something finally clicks and you either put the game down, or you begin to feel a sense of accomplishment. That is what Bloodborne is about to me. While you can level up and raise your stats, ultimately the true form of progress through the title isn't about numbers or memorizing mindless patterns but rather about learning from your mistakes and applying the lessons you've learned through the rest of your encounters with giant wolves, brain-eyeball-things, pimps, witches, giant spiders (NOPE), and a creature that can only be described as Space Cthulhu.The game is in no way a flawless masterpiece thanks to some questionable design decisions and some disappointing bugs, but Bloodborne is still a title one should at least give a shot. If you love Dark Souls and you haven't been burnt out on the series' style yet, you'll love this game. If you love Victorian London/European Gothic style worlds and aesthetics? At least watch someone play it. ",

    "review_description": "Bloodborne... if there ever was a game that made me bittersweet, this is the one I would name. Bloodborne bears nothing in name with Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Dark Souls II, but everything in spirit. Nothing is named 'souls', instead everything is named 'blood'. Make no mistake, the set up, structure, design philosophy, gameplay mechanics... it is all identical to previous games in the series.Bloodborne does make some changes to its formula, but they all - at least they seem to at first - are somewhat minor. The game is a tad faster in play than previous games in the series. There are some more aggressive enemies, your roll has been replaced with a quicker side-step while locked onto an enemy, and equip load has been taken out of the equation so your character moves fast all the time regardless of current equipped gear. Bloodborne seems more streamlined this way, which initially feels like a good thing.Bloodborne has a fantastic artdesign and core aesthetic throughout. The game's structure is most similar to Dark Souls II. There is a hub world, like in Demon's Souls, but there is mostly one interconnected world to explore like in Dark Souls. Unlike Dark Souls and more like Dark Souls II, the world branches off in several directions. Not everything is interconnected. It is worth mentioning that Bloodborne's world feels more interconnected than DSII did, but less so than Dark Souls. It found a healthy medium between the two. Nevertheless, Bloodborne soon starts feeling very linear. Even moreso than Dark Souls II, where there was always another path to explore. Another path to follow when you got stuck. Bloodborne seems to just push you in the right direction, because there aren't many directions to choose from. The world is incredibly detailed to great effect. It feels genuinely haunting and creepy. As such, the atmosphere is outstanding in the game. As a counter to that, the environments are mostly monotonous. If you've seen any footage of Bloodborne, that will be the environment you look at for 70% of the game. There are some area's that change up the tone with grasslands, a very short but good snowy world, and some nightmarish looking environments. All these area's look pretty decent, but nothing looks as good as its core aesthetic and nothing feels particularly distinctive aside from that core. Every Souls game thusfar has had area's that were so memorable, for one reason or another. Bloodborne falls short on this side. As said, it's main world where you are dropped into is very unique looking, but aside from that it misses its Anor Londo. Its Kiln of the First Flame. Its Shaded Woods. Its Shrine of Amana. There is a rather sweet twist to the world design about 60-70ish% through the game that holds narrative significance that is pretty clever and eye opening. It changes the look of the game subtly in a way I appreciated. But I would've rather taken a very diverse world, over a monotonous one that changes the lighting three quarters through, essentially.Bloodborne has a very detailed and genuinely haunting, atmospheric world. That is basically the story of Bloodborne throughout; it has some very interesting ideas, but it does so little with it, that you'd rather have them go all out on old ideas, than halfway on new ones. Take the weapons for example. Bloodborne has interesting looking weapons that can swap attack modes. These trick weapons can be anything from a straight sword, that can be altered on the fly to a greatsword. A spear that can be altered to fit a pistol on it, or two daggers that can be altered into a larger sword. These weapons have a premium feel because of this trickstyle. You can also combo the weapon's form with it's attacks, swapping from one mode to another mid-combo. With some exceptions like the mentioned spear, there isn't really any reason to do this though. You often prefer one mode over the other for certain enemies. Unlike other Souls games, you can no longer two-hand a weapon. It is all trick based. You also can't even equip the weapon in the hand of your choice. Right is for melee, left is for guns and torches. On the outset, these trick weapons seem more complex than the weapons from previous games, but after playing for a decent period of time, you'll figure out that this is not the case. The transformations are so unique and often cool looking, that they add the illusion of complexity to these weapons, that are otherwise rather simplistic. In Dark Souls II, one could have a different moveset based on which hand you'd equip the weapon, if only slightly. You could two-hand weapons, potentially changing the entire moveset of the weapon to almost a different style of combat. Then, there was dual wielding, which had its own unique moveset and changed based on which type of weapon you main-handed. When doing the math, it actually shows that Bloodborne's weapons have far fewer attack possibilities than possible before. The exception here is that they just look more different than they actually are do to the awesome visual transformation animations.Trick weapons seem very diverse, but mostly just have cool transforming animations.This seems to be a main theme in Bloodborne; it's style over substance. While initially extremely cool, it wears off before you even hit the endgame. Every step forward in presentation and aesthetic, is two steps back in terms of gameplay and options therefor. We can all acknowledge that there were 'duplicate' weapons in previous Souls games; weapons that had a different move or two and looked slightly different, but were otherwise nearly identical to another weapon in the game. While these weapons certainly existed, we must also acknowledge that just by sheer numbers, there was still tons and tons more options in Dark Souls II for instance. With 223 weapons (and even more added in Scholar of the First Sin) and over 150 spells across 4 different categories, it offered the most diversity for builds out of any Souls game. Perhaps it is not fair to directly compare these two games, but with the bare 15 trick weapons that Bloodborne provides and somewhat of 6 or 7 spells period, it feels like a skeleton compared to what you might expect. In addition, these spells are all hidden behind the final 60-70% of the game, so anything other than the build that is intended for you to play, is basically off limits until NG+. Besides that, I was able to come up with 3 actually different builds for Bloodborne, whereas I managed to finish Dark Souls with 16 different ones and DSII with 31 and counting. The options available are just very low. Another such issue is armor. There are no unique stats, no internal abilities, barely that much difference at all except for visual design.Even yet, after finishing the game twice, I have no desire to play that final build, which is possibly the worst thing I can say about a game like this: it doesn't have a lot of replayability. What seems like streamlining at first, reveals itself to be actively stripping the game of what made the series great. Just to cover all bases: it is clear that people who are used to playing Souls games exclusively in heavy armor and shields are genuinely having a tough time with Bloodborne, so if you played these games like this before the following may not apply to you; Bloodborne is too easy. Timing dodges used to be strict and tight. The timing on parry's used to be even tighter and held great risk-reward dynamics. Here, everything goes. The windows on dodges and parry's are so large, that they seem designed to have you succeed, rather than designed to make you learn patterns and anticipate attacks. I've beaten the majority of Bloodborne bosses on the first try, and I was getting frustrating by the parry's it gave me on a platter. That moment when you know you messed up, but the boss didn't hit you yet; you know this moment as I describe it. You committed to an attack, rather than a dodge. The boss was attacking at this very moment and you can almost count the frames of how late you were, knowing the inevitable blow will connect and you will die. It is a great moment to learn a boss' patterns and what not to do. This simply doesn't exist in Bloodborne. When I thought this happened, I got the parry anyway. I got the dodge. I felt like I was getting away with poor performance because the game was designed to be finished, rather than to be conquered.The bosses are generally the easy and don't require a lot to figure out.Speaking of finishing the game, it took me 26 hours to complete the game for the first time blind. I skipped two optional bosses while doing this. As such, it is the shortest Souls game I've played to date. Not necessarily a bad thing, as I felt it shouldn't have been any longer because I had long seen all its tricks. The Chalice Dungeons in the game are very neat, but not my main draw to the game. I had fun doing them for a bit, but ultimately felt like I wasn't doing it in service of anything.That's all not to say Bloodborne is a bad game. Far from it. It is probably the most refined Souls game to date. Most of what I've written thus far probably reads fairly negative. The reason for this is my deep passion for this series. I want more from this series than what Bloodborne offers. I want to be engrossed in the world for more than one playthrough. I want to be challenged for more than one playthrough. I want to play the game in different ways from the get go, not having to wait until halfway through the game before I can use what I need. The problem with Bloodborne isn't so much that it is a bad game, it's in fact a great game. The first time I played through it, I liked it a lot for most of the way to the end. The problem is that all my worries came to be true. It may be a great game, but it's not a great Souls game.I had to think really hard about the score I wanted to give to this game. If I were to recommend this game to people, I'd tell them this was a 4-star game, yet I couldn't get myself to give it as much. My reasoning here being that I came to this game in the hopes of having a game that had my attention all year, but that's just not what it did. If you are going to play this game once, or perhaps twice, then feel free to add a star to the score I gave it, because that is honestly what it deserves in that scenario. But since I play these games a certain way, over and over and over, I felt the score should reflect that to others who might be the same.",

    "review_description": "Coming straight off of Dark Souls 2, I dove right into Bloodborne. However, I don’t think that was a good idea. Naturally I instantly started making comparisons, and because Bloodborne was the new kid on the block, it took the majority of the blame. The controls seemed too fast, no shield meant that I couldn’t softball difficult characters, the lack of a simple sword to begin with, and on and on. It took a little time, but once I was past the first area I had built up my level enough and gained a better understanding of how Bloodborne wanted you to play it and I was really enjoying the game. The settings and visuals were great although seemed lacking compared to previous games in the series (yes, I consider Bloodborne to be part of the ‘Souls’ series).I think Bloodborne finally gained my admiration after I beat my first invasion. Until much later in the game I was having trouble connecting with people online. I’m not sure whether it was a network issue, or I was just doing something wrong. However, I was never able to call anyone to help me with boss fights and I was rarely if ever invaded. Once I got later in the game and I was closer to level 60, I was finally able to invite someone to help me out with a boss fight that was bothering me. Also, around the same time I was invaded by someone that was a slightly higher level than me, but I was elated when I narrowly squeaked out the win. That is when I really got into Bloodborne and it had me hooked until I put it down for The Witcher 3 (not as good of a game…).Another aspect of Bloodborne that I liked was that there was so much more to do in the game that was optional. In fact, in my opinion, one of the best areas of the game, Cainhurst Castle, is completely optional and I missed it on my first play through. I went back to it in new game plus and found it to be one of the best looking, best designed areas of the game. Also, because it was new game plus the boss of that area was an exceptional challenge that had me jumping up and down with joy when I finally beat him.I used the online wiki less for Bloodborne than I did for the previous games, but I’m not sure if this is a good thing. Finding some of the best items in the game is nearly impossible as the process of finding or acquiring them is unintuitive. However, I did look up how to get the “true” ending and was happy I did that.In the end, Bloodborne lacked the mystical allure of Demon’s Souls, the degree of perfection of Dark Souls, and the colorful, varied locations of Dark Souls 2, but it is still one of the best games I’ve played in a long time. This is mainly because it effectively incorporates some of the best aspects of the previous games to make it competent. The spot on controls, the nail-biting, unforgiving combat that captures your attention, and the moody dialogue was all there to enjoy. I recommend it to anyone that is interested in the “souls” series. Also, I would recommend it as a good horror/action game, probably better than any other besides the Resident Evil series.",

    "review_description": " From Software has an interesting fascination with death. Every game they’ve ever made seems to relish in making sure the player dies as much as possible before reaching the end. They also have a fascination with leaving you in the dark when it comes to plot details. This was the case with the action-RPG Demon’s Souls and its spiritual successor Dark Souls. With the release of Bloodborne – yet another spiritual successor to Demon’s Souls – this fascination seems to have continued. And as with the previous entries, this does not make the game any less beautiful, rewarding, or mysterious. It feels like a game made by From Software in every way, but with mechanics intended to reward those who like to mow through enemies instead of playing it safe behind a shield. Gone are the dark medieval settings from the previous Souls games. The action has now moved to the gothic horror landscape with a city named Yhardam, a vast city built with cathedrals and castles surrounded by moonlit shores and dark brooding forests housing all manner of grotesque abominations. Sharp building spires, defiled streets filled with rotting corpses and abandoned coaches, and heavy use of dark imagery like cemeteries all serve to give Yhardam a much darker atmosphere than Boletaria or Lordran could ever hope to muster. It’s also thanks to a masterful use of dark palettes that serve to not only creep you out, but to inspire a sense of awe of what was once an apparently thriving and great city, now blanketed with a thick cloud of misery and brutality. It also helps that the game features some of the best graphical details the PS4 can allow. Watching blood dripping onto the ground, your coat flapping to your movements, and the look of decay along the streets is all masterfully done. While it might not be the strongest example of the PS4’s graphical capability, it still looks fantastic. Adding to this grim landscape is an even grimmer tale of what happened to this society. You play as a foreigner traveling to Yharnam in search of its legendary medical marvels. However, Yharnam has problems of its own, having been stricken with a plague that turns its inhabitants into hideous and violent beasts. In order to survive, you must cross the city and eliminate all threats that stand in your way. By utilizing the dream-like state Yharnam is stuck in, you must uncover the mystery of this plague and rid the city of it once and for all by utilizing the skills of the hunters, those who seek to rid Yharnam of the bestial menace. To reveal any more would delve into spoiler territory. The narrative, as with the previous Souls series, is about as sparse and vague as it gets. You do get more cutscenes this time around, but they’re more content in giving context for events rather than revealing the details. The deeper details of the lorecome from item descriptions, random notes you read, NPCs you talk to, and even the environments themselves. Piecing it all together takes some careful analysis of all the parts given to you, and even its multiple endings leave more questions than answers. But such is the tradition of From Software, and it’s engaging enough to keep you interested for the brutal ride you embark on. As with the Souls games, this is an action-RPG with a focus on stat and weapon upgrades. The basics from the previous games are all there. The same life/stamina bar, the quick-equip options, and the movement animation, right down to the hilarious rag dolling that occurs with dead enemies. The combat still revolves heavily around timing your attacks wisely due to the slower animation wind ups than most games allow, as well as facing enemies that follow that same rule. It uses the same hub world system that Demon’s Souls introduced while combining it with the sprawling, interconnected landscapes of Dark Souls, complete with the occasional shortcuts between larger sections of far away areas to reduce the tedium of backtracking. This is a spiritual successor through and through, and another example of From Software’s covenant with its players: they give us the tools, and we figure out how to best utilize them in the brutal lands we journey through. The other big similarity is the collection of blood echoes, which are this game’s version of souls from the previous entries. You obtain them from killing enemies, bosses, and certain items you can find along your travels. Blood echoes are your means to level up your character, purchase items, upgrade/repair your equipment, and other such uses. If you die, any you’ve collected will be dropped in the place you died, and in order to obtain them again you must venture back to that area and recollect those lost souls, but only if you haven’t died again along the way. There are occasions where enemy might pick up your dropped echoes, during which the only way to regain them is to defeat that specific foe – they’re best recognized by their eyes now taking up a purple glow. You can also gain Insight, which is similar to Humanity from Dark Souls and are gained in a similar fashion, but has a few hidden functions that I won’t spoil for you. This allows you to not only be able to summon co-op partners (more on that later), but to also purchase specialty items from the Hunter’s Dream, should you obtain enough of them. Leveling up hasn’t changed much from the way Demon’s Souls operated. There is a doll in the Hunter’s Dream, who works much like the Black Maiden, that allows you to pay some blood echoes to increase your stats, of which there are only six this time around: vitality (health), endurance (stamina), strength, skill, bloodtinge (gun damage), and arcane (magic resistance). Having only these six stats to level up reduces the overall complexity of the game and keeps class builds simple, yet varied. The more you level up, the more echoes it takes to increase the next stat. Weapons scale upwards at varying degrees to certain stats like always, so your play style depends mainly on what kind of weapons you prefer to use and how you can best wield them, though this doesn’t change how quickly you can swing a weapon or how effectively they can stagger enemies with certain weapons, only the amount of damage done in a single swipe or gunshot. You can also use upgrade materials to increase the power of each weapon, and fortify them with blood gems, which are enhancement items that each holds a specific buff or condition, so playing around with these is encouraged. Even with those similarities, Bloodborne maintains its own identity with a few key differences from its older brothers. The first thing to note is that the action in this game encourages you to attack, attack, and attack. Yes, gone is the tactic of using a shield and waiting for the enemy to recoil before attacking – you’re even given a pathetic wooden shield to find in the game that exists to show just how useless the passive approach is (though it's great for blocking bullets, oddly enough). Now, attacking first while getting a few extra swipes as they stagger is the most potent way to progress through the streets and sewers and forests of Yharnam. Instead of shields, you now have guns, which are used to stagger your opponents should they opt to rush after you while damaging them in the process. Should you shoot them at the right moment, it allows for a visceral melee attack, similar to the riposte from the Souls series. You have a limited amount of ammo you can hold (up to 20), and you can even use some of your health to gain five bullets at a time should you run low of the normal ammo types. A few new mechanics are introduced to aid in this. First, your armor is now relegated to…well, just being clothing options with various defense stats. Each item of clothing fits with the theme of the game, so you never look out of place whenever you swap out for better defense. With this in mind, you now have the freedom to dodge, roll, and quickstep without sacrificing speed. To aid in that, your weapons now transform. Instead of switching stances with weapons, you can change the form of your weapon and change its move set entirely. You can use a sword that sheathes into a stone maul, a spear that can be used as a rifle, or even a sword that sheathes into a wider blade to use as a greatsword. All of them can even be switched mid-swing for a variety of combat circumstances, introducing a new level of depth to the already fantastic combat. For this reason, there are fewer weapons to obtain than the Souls series, but the transformations make up for this, as you’re basically wielding two different weapons in one for each option. Another new mechanic is the ability to gain the health you lost by retaliating against those that struck you. You have a limited window after being hit to swing back and regain that lost health, up to a certain amount if you’re taking multiple hits (which will be often). This keeps the pace of the combat swift without needing to retreat for healing, though there will be plenty of that either way. If you need to heal, but don’t have an opening to attack, you can use a blood vial, the replacements to the estus flasks. These are abundantly found on enemy corpses, and you can hold up to twenty at a time, but that doesn’t make it any less likely that you will die if you use them. This is due to the more intelligent AI patterns the creatures you face exhibit. Thought they still follow predictable patterns in order to give you a fighting chance, that doesn’t change the speed, power, and ferocity at which they unleash their assault. Often, you’re caught between fighting up to ten foes at once, either by running past enemies and aggroing them, or just by running into a prepositioned mob ready to string you up. Ambushes abound, but are easy to avoid if you’re being careful and observant of your environments, listening for specific sounds and watching for visual cues. For this reason, even with the added emphasis on aggressive tactics and the health regain system, it would still be wise to avoid larger mobs, instead choosing to pick them off one at a time to keep yourself alive, while also exploiting the animation interruptions present for both your and enemy attacks. This also being a horror type setting, half the time you come across enemies you should be seeing, but rather only hear, with their snarls and footsteps and unsettling groans entering the scene before revealing themselves, forcing you into a constant state of awareness that only the best horror games excel at. Aside from the weapons you use, there are also numerous items to collect, either as a temporary status buff for you or your equipment, methods to collect more blood echoes, or even navigation items to keep you from getting lost within a world that features no map, quest marker, or anything of the helpful variety. These items range from elemental weapon buffs, items that reduce your susceptibility to status ailments like poison, frenzy (which isn’t explained very well aside from peeling off three-fourths of your health), etc. These items are, once again, best used for certain areas in the game, and discovering their use remains as rewarding as ever, as is reading their descriptions to obtain the lore of the world. As for sound design, Bloodborne does a remarkable job in that department. From your boots stomping on the ground to the sounds enemies make, to even the ambient noises of the city and its outskirts, the game is a feast for the ears. The minimalist score keeps things atmospheric, with the louder, more intense orchestral pieces saved for the incredible boss fights this game features. While their patterns remain as predictable as ever, they are by no means less challenging or memorable, as they can still easily corner or pound you into submission if you don’t tread lightly and strategize on the best method of defeat. And this time, instead of fighting dragons or ancient warriors, you’re fighting creatures like werewolves, mystic spiders, and creatures that are incomprehensible to describe to the human mind, with designs seemingly inspired by H.P. Lovecraft himself. Of course, with a game as challenging as this, begging for help isn’t considered weak. The game still features online co-op, which allows up to two extra players online to aid you whenever you beckon them with a certain item (at the cost of one point of Insight). You can summon people for that one pesky boss fight that keeps killing you, or to help uncover the more hidden shortcuts you most likely missed in some of the game’s levels. You can only be summoned with a certain item, and each time you summon help brings the risk of bringing in another player who’s more interested in ending your life than aiding you. This can be avoided by killing a special enemy known as the bell-ringing woman, after which you can feel a little safer knowing another player isn’t going to steal your echoes. If they kill you, they gain all your souls, and vice versa if you manage to kill them instead. The game also provides indirect aid in the form of notes. Players can use an item called the Notebook to leave hints on the ground that can give other players clues for the area, like avoiding ambushes, leading them to hidden treasures and shortcuts, or even to just say something about the scenery or story in general. All the notes are premade from a list of phrases and words related to the overall game. There is a new feature added into Bloodborne in order to provide more content for the game. By finding special chalices throughout the game, you can unlock the so-called Chalice dungeons, which are procedurally generated labyrinths filled with enemies and treasure that you wouldn’t normally find within the main game. There are several alters with which you can create a dungeon, and each has several levels, complete with their own batch of unique enemies, aesthetics, and boss encounters. These dungeons can provide some form of relief from the main story areas, due to their overall lighter difficulty by comparison to the main areas of the campaign. They’re a good distraction for when the main game has become overwhelming. However, don’t look to them for the art or intricate level design, as they reuse many of the same assets – caverns lined with tree roots, stone room after stone room, all the same color – without much thought given to their layout, as opposed to the more varied interconnected environments that the whole of Yharnam has to offer. This game is a grand example of what the PlayStation 4 is capable of, but some technical issues still bring the game down. First, whenever the game loads after a death or fast traveling, the times in between range between thirty and forty seconds, a considerably length of time that had me sighing in disbelief most of the time. Also, the frame rate, while it maintains a consistent thirty frames per second, does tend to dip a little whenever you’re cooperating/competing with online players or when there are several enemies on screen at a time. I even found one tiny area in the game where the framerate took a massive nose dive while I was there, only to return to normal after leaving. It didn’t appear anywhere else and there were no enemies to fight, so this wasn’t a deal breaker by any means. Given those issues listed, I still find this game to be a marvel of level and combat design. The aggressive style of fighting is a welcome deviation away from the typically slow, methodical approach Dark Souls takes to combat. The art style and narrative are disturbing, yet richly detailed with enough gothic lore and implications to rival the best written horror stories. The world design is intricately built and connected, allowing for a deeper immersion into the decaying waste of a city known as Yharnam. The enemies are memorable and frightening all at once, as are the numerous NPCs you come across. With these things in mind, this game is still not for everyone, and is in no way perfect. The difficulty will turn off many looking for a more manageable experience that doesn’t rely heavily on memorization and planning. The long load times and frame stutters are annoying, the lower weapon selection is disappointing, and the Chalice dungeons left a lot to be desired in terms of overall design. However, this is one game you should at least try once in your life. This game is, in the best way possible, the antithesis and deconstruction of modern design, much like Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls are. The difficulty is such that memorization of patterns takes precedent over trying to feel like a badass. The level design leads you everywhere and nowhere, such that overcoming it boils down to remembering where certain rooms and encounters are instead of guided passages meant to be simple obstacle courses. The narrative is hardly there, making you think about things and having to discover it for yourself rather than everything being told to you while you’re powering through mobs of easy enemies. While not to say that modern games are terribly designed by comparison, From Software has proven that there are still groups of people willing to think about how to overcome obstacles instead of being told “this is the best way to win,” and then accomplishing it without guidance. It allows those people to say “I did it all by myself, and I feel great.” Though it’s not a popular decision for some, I know I prefer to feel like I achieved victory through my own way rather than playing the way the director wanted.",

    "review_description": "When Bloodborne launched earlier this year it was a special game. Still the best experience I’ve had on PlayStation 4 so far; it was a beautiful yet horrifying game. Perhaps most well known for it’s extremely hard difficulty but under the surface lies so much more. When it was all said and done I felt emotionally and physically exhausted but adored the experience.Which now brings us to The Old Hunters; Bloodborne’s first and seemingly only expansion. Jumping back into a game so unforgiving after seven months without playing definitely takes a little getting used to but I was surprised with how quickly I got back to slaying beasts with relative ease. Bloodborne’s combat is still as brutal but satisfying as ever and is one of the main draws of the game.The beginning areas of the expansion will be familiar to Bloodborne veterans. You start in what looks like an even creepier Cathedral Ward but things quickly change into something new entirely. I was worried we would see a lot of reused environments but that isn’t the case at all. Exploring and seeing new areas is a huge reason why I love this game and that is still here in full force.Early on you are tasked to fight multiple hunters which were one of the most annoying enemies to fight in the base game. They are a lot easier this time round and once you get out of the initial area you start to fight all sorts of new and returning enemies which is way better.There are sixteen new weapons contained in this expansion which cover an entire range of different types of weapons. Whilst around half just seems like slightly different versions of past favorites like the Saw Cleaver; there are so many cool weapons that are totally different to anything seen in the main game. In particular the Whirligig Saw and Holy Moonlight Sword are both awesome. It’s just a small shame they all start completely un-upgraded so for them to actually be effective and not just fun novelties you will have to spend some time upgrading them. The game also switches up previous expectations by actually including a shield that isn’t completely useless as well as brass knuckles you can use instead of a gun.As always the game has just incredible sound and level design. They are so many stunningly eerie environments to discover and one of the best parts about this expansion is how much is completely optional. If you stray from the path from time to time you will discover entirely new areas that you wouldn’t have seen otherwise. At one point I went down a dark hole which resulted in me discovering a new area that contained a brand new weapon I would have otherwise missed. There was also a previous boss from the main game just chilling down there, acting like a normal enemy which was a great touch albeit rather scary.Another interesting area is a labyrinthian room filled with long and winding staircases that sometimes lead to nowhere. It’s very reminiscent of the prison area in Demon’s Souls and starts out incredibly confusing but you slowly start to understand the layout and what you must do to progress. Truly the only sort of level design From Software are capable of.There are five bosses in total (one is optional) which is a good amount considering the original game had seventeen. For the price of entry of $19.99/£15.99 I would say it’s a very reasonable deal. Considering the amount of new weapons and areas that add to the replayability of this game it’s a small price to pay to fans of this incredible game.One major new component that was added to the game in an update in preparation for this expansion is The League. It’s basically a way to summon NPC’s into your game to help you tackle the difficult bosses. It works really well and it’s a shame it wasn’t around ages ago when more people were maybe trying out Bloodborne for the first time. People still playing it probably won’t need to summon for help but it’s a great system to add regardless.As for the new bosses themselves they are all really good well done fights. The first one is by far the hardest which shows From Software haven’t lost their twisted sense of humor and they also pull a really mean trick later in the game which was very uncalled for. Overall they are all worthy new adversaries for you to fight and wouldn’t have felt out of place in the main game.Before I played The Old Hunters I was scared. There has been a lot of forced and unnecessary DLC for games I’ve liked recently such as The Evil Within and Arkham Knight that were so poor; actually changed the way I felt about those games. I really didn’t want this to happen to Bloodborne and thankfully it has had the opposite effect. After beating the DLC I now find myself finishing off my new game + and wanting to even stick around and just help other players so I can play with all my shiny new weapons.This expansion is everything it should have been. It has provided me with more entertainment in a game I love but perhaps more importantly reminded me why I loved this game so much when it was originally released. Maybe this was intentional with game of the year just around the corner and if so it has worked wonders. If you, like myself had a blast with Bloodborne; don’t hesitate in picking up this expansion at once.",

    "review_description": " I cant remember what got me into Demon's Souls in the first place but the idea of a 3D action game reminiscent of the Zelda games of that time but more moodier, atmospheric and \"hardcore\" seemed intriguing enough to pick up and at best give it a shot. While initially hating the esoteric and challenging experience, eventually I caught the bug and Demon's Souls, even to this day, competes for my 5th slot in \"5 favorite games of all time\". Flash forward 7 years and we're now at Bloodborne, technically the fourth game with the Souls formula but treated as a separate IP. And despite playing prior entries, it's remarkable how, even with gripes, Bloodborne followed the exact same pattern: initially not digging the game until it became a game I warmed up to as time went on.Playing as a Hunter, slayer of beasts, you find yourself in Yharnam, a city reminiscent of Victorian England meets Gothic architecture, you'll come across crazed people, other hunters and some completely deformed and magnificent beasts reminiscent of the best of Lovecraft. While this is the most simplest of explanations, Bloodborne is basically the opposite of Bioware worlds: instead of complex codex entries, it's 2 sentences found on an item. Instead of long cutscenes and lengthy conversations with NPC's, NPC's are not quite as chatty and are even vague with their intentions. While it's not hard to get the basic gist of the world of Bloodborne, it doesn't make it easy to do so though it's worth exploring to find it out.The world of the game is semi open-world as you make your way through areas, exploring nooks and crannies and defeating your enemies on the way to the area's boss. The interconnected design of having everything loop around and shortcuts and alternate pathways can really impress at just how meticulously constructed everything is. The detail put into this world is also put onto the display as the various ruins and vacated streets of Yharnam really bring the player into a world that you'd rather not be in but always presents the pull to explore and find what it has to offer. The only real downside I feel to the world is despite all this, I wouldn't say it's as straight forward as prior games with many times me going \"okay, now what?\" While it's easy to marvel just how much things are in the game, it's almost just as easy to straight up miss what it has to offer.The action of Bloodborne is much more faster and requires a bit more reactions on the player's part and I'll absolutely admit the pacing didn't click with me at first. Many bosses from before were much more lumbering, gigantic dudes that can easily be baited into attacks while you hacked away at their misses but many enemies and bosses require quicker thinking and faster reflexes so while you can be the patient type, being more nimble is just as effective. However, this change starts what's probably the most exciting and (hate to use the word since it is so overused) but \"intense\" combat in the series. The sighs of relief upon vanquishing a foe seem almost louder given the quicker fights and the stylish presentation of the game really does give you that \"I'm a slick and well-dressed badass\" feeling compared to before where you were \"a dude in armor\". That being said, some things in Bloodborne actually started to grate and strangely enough makes me less enthused about further playthrough because of them. One is handling the healing so a bit of context for prior games. In Demon's Souls, healing was done via a grass consumable with different kinds offering more healing (similar to potion, hi-potion, and x-potion from traditional rpg's) and levels were structured sort of like a Mega Man stage: you had to make it from the beginning of the level to the end and beat the boss in one life with a death putting you back at the very beginning, no checkpoints. However since you made your way through the entirety of levels, you'd likely replenish and even stock up more on healing grass and increase your stock and there was no limit to how many you can carry on you since they weren't that much of a burden on your item weight. In Dark Souls, you had the estus flask: a consumable with charges that can not only be upgraded to increase the charges but increase the amount of healing provided but the big one was that they replenished your charges either upon death or touching a bonfire.In Bloodborne however, likely done since it's seen as a new IP and not technically part of the Souls series, came up with a new system: blood vials and had the 2 prior systems combined yet seems to have backfired and had all the drawbacks that came with both. While you can farm the vials as you progressed in the game, you're limited to how many you can carry on you with extra vials put automatically into a storage chest back in your hub. While they did scale off more health you have (40% of max hp) you couldn't permanently increase the charges or potency unless you equipped special runes and enchantments which takes away being able to equip other items in those same slots. Very needed in the early game given you weren't equipped with amazing gear or stats yet but in the late game they're super trivial to get, doubly so if you purchased the DLC. Added to this, any amazing farming spots were somehow more tedious given enemies didn't refresh and revive a la Dark Souls' bonfires but now it's a loading screen back to a hub and a loading screen back into the world. It's kind of a system that felt like a constant hassle as opposed to just being a minor inconvenience I'd get used to.DLC Review: Similar to the \"Artorias of the Abyss\" downloadable content released for Dark Souls, \"The Old Hunters\" is also new content that isn't a drop down from the main menu or a flashing \"NEW!\" gravestone in this case but rather requires specific steps. Upon vanquishing the boss Vicar Amelia, an area opens up which takes you to the Hunter's Nightmare, a rather lengthy dlc which adds some new weapons, bosses and areas to explore. Some bosses aside (**** you, Ludwig), the quality of the DLC is quite exceptional and the new weapons and what they offer to different builds makes it worthwhile but there's one gripe: depending on if she was 3rd or 4th boss, Vicar Amelia is fairly early into the game yet the DLC seems almost scaled higher than the level you'll likely be upon killing the boss. This can make the DLC tough for early playthroughs and is just as tough even if you're at an appropriate level. Unfortunate since the whirligig saw (dubbed the \"pizza cutter\" by the community) became an instant favorite, the rakuyo is a complete beast of a skill-based weapon and the boss fight in the clocktower (no spoilers here) actually rivals Artorias as the funnest/coolest fight in a Souls game. It's worth purchasing but maybe hold off before entering it if you're early in the game. While it took a while, the wonders and enjoyment that can be had with Bloodborne eventually started to come to me and while it won't dethrone Demon's Souls, it's a game that did click. While the urge to replay the Demon or Dark is quite strong and would likely not think twice should another playthrough come my way, certain sections (the frenzy bridge...*shudder*) or bosses or the handling of the blood vial system make me less enthused to replay the game, the other experiences surrounding the game make it a worthwhile endeavor anyway.

    "review_description": " I don't often dream of showering myself in the blood of my enemies but while playing through Bloodborne I often found myself dreaming of how to most effectively eviscerate the beasts that infest Yharnam.FromSoftware's third foray into the third-person RPG/Masochism simulator is, in my opinion, it's best yet. Gone are the shields that we so heavily rely on in the \"Souls\" games to block oncoming attacks, replaced instead by a trusty Hunter's pistol (or blunderbuss or rifle, whichever you end up choosing) which forces you to rely on parries and the more dynamic movement system. Now, instead of the patented 'roll' seen in the other Souls games you are given the ability to dodge around or away from your attackers with a short, swift leap which is the best addition to this format of game by far. Apparel no longer affects your movement so you don't have to get down to the nitty gritty of item burden every time you want to try a new set of armor. Gliding around your enemies adds a certain pace to the game that the awkward roll could never bring. You still have to rely on effective timing so as not to take a heavy hit from your target, and the enemies do hit very heavily, but the constant movement makes the pacing way more fun. Another addition to Bloodborne is the ability to recharge a little health after taking a hit. When damage is dealt by an enemy your bar of health goes down but a residual amount is left which can be refilled if you aggressively attack your target and shower yourself in their blood... so metal.This time From forgoes the high-fantasy setting and brings you into a darker, gothic environment rife with tall, pointy buildings with narrow streets which are prime for ambushes. Coffins and carriages line the infested lanes and alleys and everything has a claustrophobic feel to it that adds another level of stress to the atmosphere that makes finding the next checkpoint all that much sweeter.If difficulty was a turn off for you with the other Souls games then it's best you avoid this game. It's still tough as ever and with the new movement system and lack of shield, the first few areas are pretty difficult as you get used to it. That can also be to your benefit though as enemies act and move very similarly to the way they do in the other games and the old \"look, an item in the distance! I'm going to go grab it! *cue enemy attack from behind*\" trope is still very prevalent, even later in the game. The bosses are still punishing, but on a fun level. If and when you die, and you will die, it doesn't feel cheap. Going in for that extra attack instead of dodging, or healing when you should have attacked are mistakes I often made. Every move made in that game is executed fantastically and though I found myself yelling a few expletives throughout the course of the game, I blamed nobody but myself for my hundreds of deaths.The aesthetic of the game is absolutely beautiful with it's Gothic architecture and Victorian apparel. There's a degree of beauty that is missing from the other games. Also, the tech of the PS4 is used very well. The fur on the bestial bodies of the enemies flows with every movement, especially the bosses, whose character models are significantly bigger and therefore have more room for detail. One of the later bosses has lightning coursing through its fur adds a degree of spectacular distraction that makes an already difficult battle even tougher. Cloaks on your character flap with every step with a level of realism I've never seen before.Yeah, this guy was fun       All around this game is one of the most beautiful, visceral, frustrating and difficult games I've ever played and I loved every minute of it. I can't recommend it enough and anybody who is a fan of the Souls games but didn't get into Bloodborne because of the differences needs to play this game. The learning curve isn't all that steep and the satisfaction of beating that tough boss or the relief of finding that next lamp is just as awesome as ever. ",

    "review_description": "Bloodborne is a visceral and atmospheric action RPG developed by FromSoftware, known for its challenging and immersive titles such as Dark Souls and Demon's Souls. Released in 2015 exclusively for the PlayStation 4, Bloodborne has garnered critical acclaim for its intricate level design, challenging gameplay mechanics, and hauntingly beautiful gothic setting. In this review, we will delve deep into the dark and twisted world of Bloodborne, exploring its gameplay mechanics, story, atmosphere, and overall experience.Bloodborne's gameplay truly shines, blending intense combat, strategic exploration, and adrenaline-pumping boss battles. From the moment you enter the blood-soaked streets of Yharnam, the game sets a relentless pace that never lets up. Combat in Bloodborne is fast-paced and brutal, requiring precise timing and skill to orchestrate devastating attacks and dodges.The game's unique Regain system rewards players for aggressive playstyles, encouraging them to take risks and engage enemies head-on. This adds a layer of tension and excitement to every encounter, as players must constantly balance offence and defence to survive. The array of weapons and tools at your disposal further enhances combat depth, allowing for various playstyles and strategies.Exploration in Bloodborne is equally engaging, with intricate level design that rewards careful observation and exploration. Hidden shortcuts, secret paths, and hidden treasures are scattered throughout Yharnam, waiting to be discovered by those brave enough to venture off the beaten path. The interconnected world of Bloodborne is a marvel of level design, seamlessly weaving together various areas and shortcuts that create a sense of cohesion and immersion.Boss battles in Bloodborne are a true test of skill and perseverance, pitting players against towering monstrosities and otherworldly abominations. Each boss fight is a unique and challenging experience, requiring players to adapt to the boss's attack patterns and mechanics. The accomplishment and satisfaction of defeating a demanding boss is unmatched, making each victory feel well-earned.Bloodborne's story is intentionally cryptic and enigmatic, leaving much of its narrative open to interpretation. Set in the city of Yharnam, players take on the role of a Hunter tasked with unravelling the city's mysteries and uncovering the truth behind its dark secrets. The game's lore is deep and intricate, with a rich history and mythology that adds depth and complexity to its world.As players progress through the game, they encounter various characters, enemies, and locations that hint at the greater narrative at play. Themes of cosmic horror, madness, and transformation permeate the world of Bloodborne, creating a sense of unease and foreboding that lingers long after the game's credits roll. The game's story is told through environmental storytelling, item descriptions, and cryptic dialogue, requiring players to piece together the narrative themselves.Bloodborne's gothic setting is one of its most defining features, immersing players in a hauntingly beautiful world filled with decay, despair, and twisted horrors. The city of Yharnam is a nightmarish landscape of towering cathedrals, shadowy alleyways, and eerie swamps, all shrouded in a thick fog of dread and despair. The game's art direction and visual design are nothing short of breathtaking, with every location and creature meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of otherworldly terror.The game's sound design further enhances its atmosphere with haunting music, eerie ambient sounds, and bone-chilling screams that ratchet up the tension and fear. From the ghostly whispers of unseen monsters to the guttural growls of the grotesque beasts that roam Yharnam's streets, every sound in Bloodborne creates a sense of unease. Bloodborne is a masterfully crafted action RPG that pushes the boundaries of the genre with its challenging gameplay, intricate level design, and haunting atmosphere. From its intense combat and adrenaline-pumping boss battles to its cryptic story and atmospheric world, Bloodborne offers a gaming experience like no other. While its punishing difficulty may deter some players, those who brave the horrors of Yharnam will be rewarded with a deeply satisfying and unforgettable journey.",

    "review_description": "I like Microsoft Excel: Tabulating data, writing formulas, designing graphs--it's work, but for some reason it can be fun work. Still, it took some time and had to be spurred by that random moment when I discovered that typing in an \"=\" into a cell opened up a new world of possibility. Strangely (or, depending on your familiarity with Paradox, maybe predictably) enough, this is also the case with Victoria II--and I'm not sure when it happened, but sometime in my first multi-day game playing as secondary-power Switzerland, the game went from an obtuse jumble of the arcane to a compelling composition of depth. In typical Paradox fashion, the game initially feels completely unmanageable. A maze of menus, graphs, maps, and numbers, it's anything but intuitive. As someone who has played Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron, I had the advantage of understanding basic interface setups, map control, and military management. Nevertheless, it still took multiple hours to figure out the basics--I'm over twenty hours in and still feel like I've only recently hit an average level of understanding. I have yet to actually complete a full run through of the game and find myself continually restarting to try out a different strategy, or explore a different layer of what's offered--be it trade, military, colonization, or citizen management. But I keep restarting, I keep trying those new strategies, and I keep visiting the Paradox forums to read fan AARs (After Action Reports--basically game diaries written by fans playing through campaigns). Victoria is an experience that requires homework and it feels worth it.I'm really not sure how a complete Paradox novice could stand to get started with V2, but the person who remains interested in the game after looking at screenshots is likely to be the same person with the patience to read the Paradox forums and the 100+ page strategy guide. With enough time, they may even find it to be more fun than Excel, even though you may never be able to run a Pac-Man macro in Victoria II. ",

    "review_description": "Well, I have already talked endlessly about Europa Universalis III, but oddly enough, that was not my first deviation into Grand Strategy. In fact, the much more challenging Victoria II was indeed my first.Now, that raises some alarms if you read my EU3 review and read how much of a moronic fuck I was. I somehow managed to get destroyed in that game with cheats on.Oh boy, here we go.Well, I first bought Victoria II when I saw a thread for Grand Strategy games on my local gaming forum. I quickly got interested. My memory, as you might know, is absolute shit. It's a wonder I can even remember my first name. So I will likely be recounting plenty of things that never actually happened.I think there was a demo for this, and I tried it out. I quite liked it, and purchased the full game, and got playing with no real introduction.I tried the tutorials first. I've heard they were the best of all Paradox Games, so I am quite afraid to see what atrocities the other tutorials are, because I barely learned anything from that damn thing. Still, I trudged onward, like a brave soldier trudging through the mud, still valiantly attempting to take the hill from a larger force.Much like that brave soldier, I was also shot in the face.Okay, shot metaphorically anyways. I started the game and played as (of course) Prussia. Now, you might not know this, but Prussia is not very easy to play as for beginners. Hell, some veterans struggle with it. So when I tried it, you can guess what the outcome was.Basically, I went to war with Austria to try and unify Germany, and I failed miserably. I made WWII Italy look like the Mongol Horde. The Austrians slaughtered me and my allies, fucked the corpses, and fired the dismembered heads at the Reichstag.Okay, maybe it wasn't that bad, but still.So I figured that I just made a bad choice. I decided to play as Russia, who I knew from historical knowledge was virtually unstoppable at this time. I knew I could easily succeed as them, right?Hehe, fuck no.I tried learning the ropes. In doing so, I beat up on several tiny, Asian countries and took all of their completely useless land. I then noticed a peculiar little addition to the economics screen. This was the tariff. I was young and amazingly stupid, so I did not really know what a tariff was. I decided it was \"free money\" and raised it to neigh 70 percent.I lasted a year before every province from Moscow to the Bearing Strait was filled with rebels, who stacked shoulder to shoulder, were likely bigger than the entire Iberian Peninsula. A massive force of Vodka fueled rage was set upon me.I can only picture the events that transcribed: The peasants revolted and charged my lines with pitchforks. All seemed in my favor, till the insane Woodsmen of Siberia rode in to save the day. They likely rode atop bears and wielded Kalashnikovs, despite that being nearly 100 years away as far as inventions go.My entire country was occupied and the world liquor sales fell immensely, as there were no more Russians to heavily drink away their ration coupons. Reflecting on that, they didn't even have coupons. Nor did they have money, since I taxed them like they were wallets with legs.Well, I finally did what I should have done a long time ago and played as France.I know, despicable, how could I stoop to such a level? But still, I felt if I must progress...Anyways, my time as Supreme Emperor of Everything Under the Sun was surprisingly uneventful. France had a massive liberal uprising followed by conservative backlash, my culture degraded and I lost prestige, my crime rate went up, my economy boomed then busted, and I invaded some tiny, shitty nations in the Middle East. So basically I became America.Recently, I played again using formulated plans, strategies, and experience to try and form Germany.And guess what I did, dear viewer.No, I didn't fail miserably and burn to death while cursing at god. I succeeded! Germany was united and earned it's place as Empire in the Sun. That game is still going, and it's mostly me beating the shit out of my neighbors like some terrible backwoods neighborhood in Georgia.All in all, Vicky2 is far more complex economically, but fails to deliver map-painting on such a scale as EU3. Warfare is also slow at times and can be frustrating, so plan accordingly. However, I found is easier to master than EU3, and for that, I award it with half a star more.Hooray...",

    "review_description": "Paradox Interactive have a certain DNA to them that make them instantly recognizable. The top-down map view is just as you can see it in Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis III. You play as one of the states that existed in 1836, or 1861 with the A House Divided expansion. There are no win conditions in Victoria II, but as with all of these types of strategy games the ultimate goal is world domination.This might be the most complex and detailed release from Paradox. The game includes a tech tree, election simulations, political movements and suppression, reform decisions, industrialization, economic management, trade policies, military composition, battles, military leadership traits, and dozens of event decisions. I am not sure it is possible to communicate all of the different aspects of the game effectively without a Quick Look.Nations are ranked and the top eight are referred to as Great Powers. Great Powers have diplomatic powers beyond secondary powers, and can create spheres of influence and intervene in conflicts. Rankings are determined by three fields, military, industry and prestige. Military scores are simply a total of your military assets (army and navy). Industry is calculated through the total number and size of factories in your provinces. Prestige is somewhat vague. Prestige, for lack of a better term, comes from glory - victories in war, increasing your sphere of influence, undertaking expeditions, making new discoveries and building colonies.I applaud Paradox's ambitious, complicated and detailed game design. Trying to recapture the spirit of the 19th century and the form of statecraft of the period is very difficult, but the competing forces of ideology, nationalism, reform and diplomacy are well represented in this game. I have always been fascinated by that era's history and feel this is remarkably authentic.This complexity comes at a price. The game has a very steep learning curve. Even after over 40 hours of game play I hardly feel like I am \"good\" at the underlying mechanics. The tutorial is insufficient to help one learn the critical skills. Going online and visiting the wikis and forums discussing basic strategies will be far more helpful. Combat is particularly difficult. Improved army composition helps, but sometimes you'll find yourself with superior numbers and comparable (or superior) tech falling back.The win condition of the game, becoming the number one Great Power, is incredibly difficult unless you're playing at Great Britain. As with our actual history the British Empire was preeminent after the Napoleonic Wars, therefore unseating that particular behemoth is very difficult, though not impossible. That's perhaps a weakness of Victoria II, it can often not feel very \"gamey\". It is not always possible to engage in the \"power fantasy\" idea and rule the world, stretching across it as a behemoth when you start playing as Denmark. Even the other Great Powers at the start of the game face a great deal of difficulty. It's that challenge that makes the game enjoyable. When you win a war, establish a new colony or sneak up the rankings a slot or two you gain a real feeling of accomplishment.Despite all of the strengths of Paradox's initial release of Victoria II: A House Divided, one of the best features is the active mod community. I personally recommend A Population Divided. This mod adds more historical events, expands the reform system and generally tweaks the game for a smoother and more refined game experience. The tech tree can feel imbalanced and some techs seem far less valuable than others, which is also corrected.Overall, this is a superb strategy game. Though at times it feels monstrously difficult it has so many systems worth exploring and divergent paths to take that players will find something new to do each time.",
